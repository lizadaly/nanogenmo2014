# AN INTERLINEAR ARCHIVE OF VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT TRANSCRIPTIONS IN EVA
# ==================================================================
#
# OVERVIEW
#
# Edited by J. Stolfi
# Release 1.6e6 - ?? Dec 1998
#
# This file was derived mainly from 
#
#   INTERLN.EVT file version 1.6, by Gabriel Landini (27 Sep 1996)
#
#   Partial transcriptions by John Grove, posted to the Voynich mailing list.
#
#   Partial transcriptions by Jorge Stolfi.
#
#   A COMPLETE transcription by Takeshi Takahashi (25 Nov 1998).
#
# The bulk of the text taken from INTERLN.EVT consisted of the
# historical (punchcard) transcriptions by W. Friedman, M. D'Imperio,
# C. Currier, and others, re-typed, edited and published by Jim Reeds,
# Jim Guillogly and Jacques Guy. See sections <f0.I> and <f0.J> for more
# details.
#
# The version by T. Takahashi was fetched from his site on 25 Nov
# 1998. It is the first complete transcription of the VMS, and the
# only one in this file that uses the full EVA encoding (including
# "weirdos").
#
# Extensive edits were made to the above files by J. Stolfi, mostly
# affecting comments, line and paragraph breaks, and line numbering.
# Here is a quick summary:
#
#   Split into separate files (one per textual unit).
#
#   Added "text unit" codes (usually ".P") to main text lines.
#
#   Mapped to the EVA encoding.
#
#   Unfolded  '[|]' choices into separate lines.
#
#   Added many new transcriptions and comments.
#
#   Corrected many line-breaking errors in the interlinear file.
#
#   Abolished the "astro"/"cosmo" distinction; it is all "cosmo" now.
#
#   Added unit header lines "<fNNN.UU> {...}" besides page headers.
#
# On the other hand, no text characters or word breaks were
# (consciously) changed. More details about the edits can be found in
# the other parts of this introduction (sections <f0.*>).

# FILE INTERLN.EVT VERSION 1.6
# Original description by by Gabriel Landini, 27 Sep 1996.
#
# [ Amendments/additions by J. Stolfi in "[]" ]
# 
# This file [ INTERLN.EVT ] is an interlinear version of the Voynich
# manuscript transcriptions from:
#
# a) P. Currier + new additions by the VMS list members (Jim Gillogly,
#    Jim Reeds, Mike Roe 1990-1994)
# b) the First Study Group (W. Friedman 1945-1949)
# c) other pages transcriptions (Don Latham 1996, Mike Roe 1996,
#    John H. Tiltman 1951, Karl Kluge 1992, Jim Reeds 1996)
#
# Please report any problems to: G.Landini@bham.ac.uk or to the Voynich
# list: Voynich@rand.org
#
# To join the Voynich list, send e-mail to Voynich-request@rand.org
#
# I will be responsible for keeping this file corrected and updated,
# so if you find any corrections, please contact me so they can be
# included in the next version of this file. All credits and thanks to
# the members of the Voynich list who made the original transcriptions
# available on line.
#
# This file was produced for the EVMT project (European Voynich
# Manuscript Transcription) by G. Landini and R. Zandbergen. We intend
# to transcribe the whole manuscript from T. C. Petersen's hand
# transcription of a set of photostats (1931) and from previous
# transcriptions available in machine readable format. The
# transcription will use the EVA alphabet that will allow translation
# of the document into the three most common alphabets associated with
# the manuscript: FSG alphabet, Currier's alphabet and Frogguy (by
# Jacques Guy).
#
# INTERLN17.EVT is based on the files: voynich.now, FSG.NEW and
# tiltman.txt with some small corrections. The Currier version was
# originally coded in Currier's alphabet. I translated it to FSG
# "enhanced" alphabet using Jacques Guy's BITRANS program and a set of
# rules CUR2FSG2 based on a message by Jim Reeds to the Voynich
# mailing list.
#
# The FSG alphabet does not contain the Currier characters 6 and 7. To
# preserve these, characters 6 and 7 were kept unchanged in the resulting
# FSG version. Currier 6 usually corresponds to K in FSG, while 7 was
# transcribed as K or 8 by the FSG team.
#
# I added a few "end of line" - and "end of paragraph" = marks where missing
# to keep line lengths equal between versions.
# All double spaces ",," were replaced with single spaces.
#
# FORMAT OF THIS FILE
# -------------------
#
# Logical divisions
# -----------------
# 
# The file is divided into logical "pages", which are subdivided into 
# "units", so that each unit contains only one type of text (paragraphs,
# labels, circular lines, etc; see section <f0.S> for more details.
#
# 
# Locators
# --------
# 
# [ Locators are constructs used to identify a page, a logical text
# unit, or a line of the VMS. Locators usually ] appear in angle brackets <>.
#
# The format of a [ page locator ] is: "f" plus the folio number, plus
# "r" for "recto" or "v" for "verso", and sometimes a further number
# for complex folios, [ all within <> ]. Ex: <f1v> indicates folio 1
# verso; [ <f101r2> indicates the second page of the fold-out folio 101,
# recto. See Jim Reeds site for a complete list of folios and 
# their division into pages. ]
#
# [ A unit locator has the form <fNNN.UU> where <fNNN> is the page
# locator and UU is a tag that identifies the unit within the page:
# typically "P" or "P1", "P2",... for paragraph-formatted blocks,
# "L1", "L2", ... for labels, and so on. ]
#
# [ A line locator has the form <fNNN.UU.LL;T> where <fNNN.UU> is
# the unit locator; LL is the line number; and T is the transcriber's
# code.
#
# The line number is a non-negative integer, optionally followed by a
# lowercase letter { a ... e }. The transcriber code is an uppercase
# letter. ]
#
# In a few places there was a "first" line not present in one of the
# other versions. These lines were numbered [ "0", or "0a", "0b",
# etc... Examples: <f41v.T.0;C>, <f84v.P.0a;C>, <f84v.P.0b;F>. ]
#
# The unit tags and line numbers for labels and other non-paragraph
# text were standardized across versions, in all cases where there
# were conflicts. The original locators were usually retained as '{}'
# comments at the end of the line. ]
#
#
# Line format
# -----------
#
# [ Each line in the file can be 
#
#   (a) a /line comment/, identified by a "#" in column 1.
#  
#   (b) a /page header/ or /unit header/, containing a page or unit locator
#       in column 1, followed by "parsable information";
#  
#   (c) a /data line/, with a line locator in columns 1-19 plus one line of
#       Voynich text starting on column 20 (which may contain in-line comments).
#
# To simplify parsing by Unix tools, the page/unit header lines (b)
# were "passivated" by inserting "## " in front of them. These are the
# only lines that begin with "##". ]
#
# As in the original transcription files, text limited by curly brackets {}
# is a comment.
#
#
# Transcriber codes
# -----------------
#
# [ The following transcriber codes were inherited from INTERLN.EVT: ]
#
#   C: Currier's transcription plus new additions from members of the
#      voynich list as found in the file voynich.now.
#   F: First study group's (Friedman's) transcription including various
#      items as found in the file FSG.NEW.
#   T: John Tiltman's transcription of some pages.
#   L: Don Latham's recent transcription of some pages.
#   R: Mike Roe's recent transcription of some pages.
#   K: Karl Kluge's transcription of some labels from Petersen's copies.
#   J: Jim Reed's transcription of some previously unreadable characters.
#   
# [ The following codes were added by J. Stolfi after 05 Nov 1997,
# in the unfolding of "[|]" groups:
#
#   D: second choice from [|] in "C" lines.
#   G: second choice from [|] in "F" lines, mostly from [1609|16xx].
#   I: second choice from [|] in "J" lines.
#   Q: second choice from [|] in "K" lines.
#   M: second choice from [|] in "L" lines. 
#   
# The following codes were assigned by J. Stolfi for use in 
# "new" transcriptions:
#
#   H: Takeshi Takahashi's full transcription (see f0.K).
#   N: Gabriel Landini.
#   U: Jorge Stolfi.
#   V: John Grove.
#   P: Father Th. Petersen (a few readings reported by K. Kluge).
#   X: Denis V. Mardle.
#   Z: Rene Zandbergen.
# ]
#
# 
# Parsable information
# --------------------
#
# Rene Zandbergen has added the Parsable Information to this file:
#
# A special type of in-line comment appears after the [ page/unit
# locator in page/unit header lines (type b1) ]. We call this
# "parsable information". The information is coded in "variables" set
# to values specific for that [ page/unit ], to facilitate the parsing
# and filtering using VTT. The variable names are single characters
# preceded by the $ symbol and they take as value a single character:
#
#      $I = illustration type  (T,H,A,Z,B,C,P,S)
#           Text, Herbal, Astronomical, Zodiac, Biological, Cosmological,
#           Pharmaceutical or Stars.
#      $Q = Quire              (A-T)
#      $P = page in quire      (A-X)
#      $L = Currier's language (A,B)
#      $H = Currier's hand     (1,2,3,4,5,X,Y)
#      $N = has non-Voynich text   (Y)
#      $K = has key-like sequence  (Y)
#      $X = has extraneous writing (Y)
#
#    Ex:  <f5r> {$I=H $Q=A $P=I $L=A $H=1 $N=Y} indicates a Herbal page
#    in quire A, page I, Currier Language A, hand 1 and has non-Voynich
#    text. Refer to the VTT documentation for details on how to use the
#    parsable information.
#
#
# Filler characters
# -----------------
#
# [ The filler characters "!" and "%" are used to align the various
# version of the same line, with slightly different meanings. 
#
# The "%" filler is used for relatively long stretches (at least one
# full word, usually next to or across a line break) that were
# obviously skipped or lost in one particular transcription of a line.
# A "%" can be interpreted as "this transcription contains no
# information about this part of the VMS text." Thus a line that is
# omitted from a particular version is equivalent to a line full of
# "%"s.
#
# The "!" filler is used for all other purposes. It denotes a
# character or word break that was either skipped or lost, or that
# (according to the transcriber) does not exist. In particular "!" is
# generally used where other versions have {}-comments.
#
# It is always OK to insert a "!" anywhere in the Voynich text. It is
# also OK to use "!" instead of "%", although the latter is more
# informative, and can be handled differently when computing
# "majority" and "consensus" versions. That is, "%" means "no vote on
# this character" while "!" means "one vote for there being no
# character here".
#
# Note that the original INTERLN file used "%" and "!" as fillers
# with somewhat different meanings. ]
#
#
# Alternative versions
# --------------------
#
# The Friedman version (FSG.NEW) is composed of various items and
# therefore there are variations within FSG.NEW. [ In INTERLN.EVT,
# this variation was ] indicated as [A|B], meaning that one item has a
# character transcribed as an "A" and the other a "B". [ These '[|]'
# constructs were later unfolded into separate lines, identified by
# distinctive transcriber codes; see the table above. ]
#
# Because the brackets and the "or" symbol | also break the
# synchronism but do not indicate any Voynich characters in the
# sequence, the exclamation mark "!" was used to indicate that the
# other version has extra characters that do not code Voynich text. ]
#
# 
# Breaks and spaces
# -----------------
#
# [ Breaksin the text are indicated according to the EVA conventions:
#
#     ","  A dubious word break.
#
#     "."  A definite word break.
#
#     "-"  In line-final position: a line break within a paragraph.
#          Elsewhere: a major break in the text---an extra-wide
#          gap, an intruding figure, a vellum defect, etc..
#
#     "="  Always in line-final position: a paragraph break
#          (defined by extra interline space, use of <p> and <f> gallows,
#          incomplete previous line, end of page, etc.
# 
# The word breaks ("." and ",") are taken from the transcription. The
# figure, line, and paragraph breaks ("-" and "=") were inserted by
# the editord of the interlinear, by looking at the reproductions of
# the VMS, without regard for the transcriber's opinion. This should
# not matter much, since the line breaks are hardly in question, and
# most paragraph breaks are fairly obvious too.
#
# Every line must end with either "-" or "=", or, in the case of
# circular lines, with "." or ",". There should be at least one normal
# letter between two succesive break characters (",", ".", "-", or
# "=").

# FILE FSG.NEW
# Original description by Jim Reeds, 18 Jun 1994
#
# [ Amendments/additions by J. Stolfi in "[]" ]
#
# [ The file fsg.new is a ] combined version of all First Study Group
# transcriptions found in William F. Friedman Collection, Marshall
# Library, Lexington, Virginia.
#
# These are:
#
#   Item 1609, an almost complete transcription of all of the VMS
#
#   A transcription found in folder 1613, of f111v through f114r
#
#   An unnumbered item, seemingly a partial draft of 1609, of f41r - f58r
#
# Comments in item 1609 have not been transfered to this file.
#
# These have been edited together, with points of difference indicated
# thus:  toma[y|h]to, meaning the one version reads tomayto and the other
# reads tomahto.
#
# Line ends have been marked with - and paragraph ends with =
#
# Line ends have been ruthlessly supplied from other partial transcriptions
# of the VMS and in some cases from inspection of photocopies.
#
# Since much of the the FSG transcription was unchecked, there are numerous
# transcription blunders, caused by eye skip, line omission, and possibly
# by IBM card loss.  In some cases these mistakes were so severe that it
# was impossible to insert line ends correctly.
#
# [ Many additional line breaking and ordering errors in the FSG
# transcriptions were fixed by J. Stolfi, after conversion to EVA.
# Most (but probably not all) of these fixes are listed in section
# <f0.W>. ]

# TAKESHI TAKAHASHI'S FULL TRANSCRIPTION
#
# Takeshi Takahashi announced on 25 Nov 1998 the first
# complete, single-handed transcription of the VMS:
# 
#   http://www3.justnet.ne.jp/~ttakahashike/voynich/pages/index.htm
# 
# In his words, it was "hard work and took me half a year to
# transcribe". We can believe that.  He adds:
# 
#   ------------------------------------------------------------
#   I transcribed in EVA solely by referencing the VMs. I did not
#   cross-reference with either FSG or the Currier transcriptions.
# 
#   I tried to transcribe as the text appeared, so I sometimes ignored
#   apparent spaces between words.
#   
#   Maybe this is not a good analysis. (I mean, originally two words, maybe,
#   at some case, I recognized one word. It is very difficult to distinguish
#   a space.)
#
#   I had difficulty in distinguishing <a> from <o>, <r> from <s> and <g>
#   from <m>. 
#
#   When I couldn't make out a tail on an <a>, I transcribed <o>.
#
#   I distinguished <cs> from <Sh>, but I have no idea whether this
#   distinction is necessary or not.
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Takeshi's transcription was published in HTML format, with word breaks 
# encoded as " ". Merging with the other transcriptions required
# extensive edits to that file, affecting mainly line breaks,
# paragraph marks, and label ordering.  The main changes were:
#
#   Removed HTML formatting.
#
#   Split, merged and rearranged some lines.
#
#   Added or removed "#"-comments, "{}"-comments and "!" fillers.
#
#   Changed some spacers (".", "-", "=").
# 
#   Changed HTML-style weirdo notation "&nnn;" to 8-bit chars and vice-versa.
#
# On the other hand, the text characters and word division were not changed,
# so all the edits can be considered "cosmetic surgery".

#
# DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERLN.EVT AND THE PRESENT FILE
# By Jorge Stolfi since Sep 1997
#
# I made many changes to the format and comments
# of Gabriel's INTERLN.EVT, after fetching it on Sep/Oct 1997.
#
# * I converted the file to the EVA alphabet.  This step is
#   described in more detail in section <f0.V>.
#
# * I expanded lines with the "[|]" notation into line pairs
#   with different transcriber codes.  This step is described
#   in section <f0.U>.
#
# * I split the interlinear into many separate files: one file
#   for each page, containing only comments, and one file for each
#   "text unit" or "locus" (block of homogeneous-looking text) within
#   the page. This step is detailed in section <f0.S>.
#   
# * I replaced some non-FSG characters found in INTERLN.EVT by "*" or by
#   valid EVA characters, as it seemed appropriate, usually leaving the 
#   original as an {}-comment.
#   
# * I fixed many missing or bogus "-" and "=".
#
# * I fixed several line-breaking errors in INTERLN.EVT,
#   mostly cases where the last character of a line was omitted and
#   entered as a separate word on the following line. I tried to
#   record all these fixes in section <f0.W>.
#   
# * I reassigned the text unit codes  in a more consistent
#   manner across the manuscript.  Specifically, to each *set* of
#   labels in a text unit (e.g. all the stars, or all the spokes) I
#   assigned a single text unit code, e.g. "L1", "L2", etc..
#
# * I assigned also to the "anonymous" units (paragraph-formatted text) 
#   an explicit "P" code, or "P1", "P2", ... on pages where the
#   paragraphed text was broken by labels or other kinds of text.
#   (There are a few exceptions; for instance, on f66r (the three-way
#   table), I used "R" for the anonymous locus (the right-hand
#   column).
#
# * I added various new transcriptions, mainly by John Grove
#   and myself, plus some items by R. Zandbergen and R. Firth. 
#
# * I merged Takeshi Takahashi's complete transcription with the
#   interlinear.   See seection <f0.K>.
# 
# * I moved all comments relating to a specific text unit to the 
#   beginning of that unit. Sometimes this required splitting,
#   rearranging, or otherwise editing the comments.
#
# * I removed all comments of the form "# page NNN"  since that
#   numbering was inconsistent with the binding order. (For one thing,
#   the last page f116v, which should be even, was numbered 235).
# 
# * I replaced the word "folio" in comments by "panel" or "page", 
#   whenever it meant only one face of a folio (or one part of a
#   multi-part fold-out).
#   
# * I added many descriptive comments, and merged into the file 
#   several scattered databases (such as Jim Reeds's color usage
#   tables, Petersen's plant names, etc.)
#   
# * I fixed the line locators <...> of labels so that all 
#   transcriptions of the same label now have the same line locator.
#   I retained the original locators as {}-comments at the
#   end of each line.  
# 
# * I split multiline labels so that each line of each label 
#   is now entered in a separate line of the file, with a distinct
#   line locator. (Embedded "-"s should now be used only for intrusions of
#   a figure or a vellum defect in a single line of the manuscript.)
#
# * I appended a "=" to the end of each label and isolated text line.  
#   For multiline labels, I used "-" to terminate each line but the
#   last one.
#
# * I regularized the transcription of circular text, sometimes
#   shifting the starting point. I used an "=" terminator where the
#   starting poing is clearly marked, "-" where it is merely a
#   larger-than-normal gap, and "." where it is an arbitrarily chosen
#   word gap.
# 
# * I replaced all page header lines (containing only a page locator
#   <...> and no Voynich text) by special "#" comments, compatible 
#   with R. Zandbergen's VTX tool. These comments have the form
#
#       ## <fNNN>        {$I=i $Q=q $P=p $L=l $H=h $X=x}
#
#   where 
#     
#       "NNN" is a page f-number (folio, side, and division, e.g f86v3)
#       "i"   is the section code ("T" for text, "H" for herbal, etc.);
#       "q"   is the quire code, a letter in [A-T];
#       "p"   is a letter in [A-Z] identifying the panel within the quire;
#       "l"   is the "language" in Currier's sense, "A" or "B";
#       "h"   is the calligraphic "hand", a character in [1-5XY];
#       "x"   is a miscellaneous attribute (a letter). 
#
#   The "$L" and "$H" attributes are omitted when unknown. The "$X"
#   attribute is present only for page f17r, which is marked "$X=U"
#   (for the extraneous writing?).
#
#   Be warned that there are some discrepancies between these "$I"
#   attributes and the section recorded in Stolfi's UNITS file. The
#   UNITS file is more conservative, and assigns section "?" to some
#   text-only pages whose "$I"-codes were apparently assigned by
#   analogy with adjacent pages.  Moreover, the UNITS file does
#   not distinguish between "astro" and "cosmo" pages.
#     
# * I also added "unit header lines", similar to the page headers above,
#   at the start of each text unit within a page.  The format of 
#   these unit headers is 
#
#       ## <fNNN.UU>     {}
#
#   where <fNNN> is the page locator, and "UU" is the tag identifying
#   the unit ("locus") within the page. Note that unit headers are
#   distinguished from page headers by the "." in the locator. The
#   empty attribute list "{}" was added for uniformity and future
#   expansion.
#
# * I replaced purely alphabetic line numbers "a" and "b" by "0a" 
#   and "0b".  Now the line number always begins with digit, and the
#   unit code always begins with a letter.
#   
# * I created dummy files for all the missing pages (as deduced from 
#   the folio numbers in the VMs itself).  For that purpose, I assumed
#   each missing folio had only two panels (recto and verso), and
#   arbitrarily assigned them "$P"-codes higher than the "non-missing"
#   panels, and section "$I"-code "M" (for "missing").
#
# * I hereby apologize for using so many "I"s in this section.

# SPLITTING LANDINI'S INTERLINEAR INTO TEXT UNITS
# J. Stolfi 12 Oct 1997
# 
# Overview
# 
#   To simplify(?) the handling and editing of the interlinear
#   file, I split each page into what I called "textual units".
# 
#   I defined a textual unit as a maximal subset of a page that 
#   is contiguous in "normal" reading order, and has 
#   homogeneous "text type"; which is one of:
# 
#     "parags"      
# 
#       Apparently prose, in multi-line paragraphs. The last line in
#       each paragraph ends with "=", other lines end with "-".
#       Paragraph boundaries are guessed from line spacing,
#       right-margin justification, and presence of <p> and <f>
#       gallows.
# 
#     "starred-parags"    
# 
#       Like parags, but with a star-like symbol in front of each
#       paragraph.
# 
#     "itemized-parags"
# 
#       Like parags, but with a single Voynich letter or symbol 
#       in front of each paragraph.  Here the letters are indicated in
#       "{}" comments; they are also listed separately as a "letters" unit.
# 
#     "circular-lines"
# 
#       Text where each line is written around a circle in some
#       diagram.  The lines are terminated by "=", "-", or "."
#       depending on how well is the starting point marked.
# 
#     "radial-lines"
# 
#       Text where each line is written along a ray in some diagram.
#       Each line is terminated by "=".
# 
#     "titles"
# 
#       Text where each line is a title for a page or figure.
#       This type includes John Grove's "titles" or "signatures",
#       non-justified lines found below some paragraphs.
#       Each title is terminated by "=".
# 
#     "itemized-lines"
# 
#       The right-hand column of an itemized list ("key-like
#       sequence").  Here each line of text is an "item" of the list,
#       and is terminated by "=".
# 
#     "labels"
# 
#       List of labels attached to parts of figures.
#       Also the column of words from the table in f66r (page 117).
#       Here each label is terminated by "=", and multiple
#       lines of the same label are separated by "-".
# 
#     "letters"
# 
#       The single-letter labels in itemized lists. Also the column of
#       single letters in f66r (page 117). Letter sequences written
#       horizontally are transcribed all on the same line, with "-"
#       separators. Other sequences are transcribed one letter per
#       line, with "=" terminators.
# 
#     "-"
#     
#       This "text type" is used for files or units that contain
#       no Voynich text, only comments.
#       
#     "?"
#     
#       This text type is used for units that (presumably) contain
#       Voynich text of unknown type (e.g. missing pages).
# 
# Unit numbering and file names
# 
#   Each unit is stored as a separate file named "fNNN.UU", where
#   "NNN" is the folio-based page number (folio, side, and division,
#   e.g. f85r2), and UU is the unit code within the page.
#   
#   Descriptive comments that apply to a whole panel are stored in a
#   separate file named "fNNN" (without location code). General
#   comments about the VMS were moved to files <f0.*>.
#   
#   Note that it was sometimes necessary to split a page with N
#   distinct text types into *more* than N units, in order to preserve
#   the "natural" ordering of the text. For example, the transcribed
#   "pharma" pages have blocks of normal text alternating with rows of
#   labels; each block of text and each row of labels have therefore
#   been made into a separate unit.
#   
#   Note that any logical page or textual unit that spans multiple panels
#   gets its page number from its first full-size panel, in "normal" reading
#   order.  So a page that spans panels f101r1 and f101r2 would be numbered
#   <f101r1>; whereas one that spans f101v1 and f101v2 would be numbered
#   <f101v2>.
#   
# Detailed description of files
# 
#   A detailed description of the splitting can be found in 
#   the "UNITS" file. Each line of UNITS describes one of the 
#   textual units above; it contains 8 fields separated by ":"
#   
#     [1] a 4-digit sequence number, which can be used to sort the
#         units in their "natural" reading order.
#       
#     [2] the file name (fNNN or fNNN.UU).
#     
#     [3] the "section", or apparent subject matter: "herbal", "bio", "cosmo", 
#         "pharma", "stars", "?" if unknown, or "-" if the file 
#         contains no text.
#       
#     [4] the "language" in Currier's sense ("A", "B", "?" if unknown, "-" if no text).
#     
#     [5] the "hand" ("1..5", "X", "Y", "?", or "-")
#     
#     [6] the type of text ("parags", "labels", etc.; see list above)
#
#     [7] a sequential page number ("p001".. "p234"), in binding order;
#         or "-" for files that are place-holders for missing folios.
#     
#     [8] other comments
#     
#   Any field may be followed by "?" denoting uncertainty.

# NOTES ON THE UNFOLDING OF "[|]" ALTERNATIVES
# Jorge Stolfi 05 Nov 1997
#
# To simplify processing of the text, I expanded the "[|]" notation
# used in Gabriel Landini's interlinear file v1.6. Each line that
# included one or more such alternations was replaced by a pair lines,
# one using only the first choice of every alternation, the other
# using only the second choice out of every alternation.
#
# For the extra lines resulting from the unfolding of '[|]' constructs,
# I used these codes:
#
#   D: second choice from "C" lines
#   G: second choice from "F" lines
#   I: second choice from "J" lines
#   Q: second choice from "K" lines
#   M: second choice from "L" lines
#
# Unfortunately I had to remove the "!" and "%" padding characters in
# the unfolding process, since they no longer provided the proper
# alignment between the unfolded versions and un-unfolded versions.
# Fixing this problem would have required processing all versions of
# of one line at once, and effectively computing a consensus for it.

# CONVERSION OF INTERLN.EVT TO THE EVA ENCODING
# Jorge Stolfi 05 Nov 1997 (Corrected 31 Mar 1998)
#
# This step was done with "fsg2eva", an AWK
# script. The main part of the script follows:
#
#   function fsg_to_eva(txt)
#   {
#     # Converts a chunk of comment-free FSG text to EVA
#
#     # We discard  "%" and "!" since the conversion
#     # will destroy synchronism anyway.
#     gsub(/[% !]/, "", txt);
#
#     # Now convert
#     gsub(/IIIE/, "iiil",  txt);

#
# This procedure was applied to the Voynich text proper, preserving
# the '#' and '{}' comments as well as the location codes.
#
# I had to edit manually some '{}' comments that contained Voynich

# were
#
#   f100r.P1  f100r.m  f100v.M  f103r.P  f104r.P  f49v.P  f65v.P
#   f66r.R    f76r.R   f89r1.b  f89r2.b
#
# Note: The 05 Nov 1997 version of this script incorrectly mapped "IK"
# to "ik" instead of "im". This error affected 79 lines of INTERLN.EVT
# representing about 50 distinct words. The error was corrected on 31
# Mar 1998, by manually editing the EVA translation of those lines.
# The endings "IIIK", "IIK", and "K" were not affected by this error.

# LINE BREAKING AND OTHER TRANSCRIPTION BUGS IN INTERLN.EVT
# by Jorge Stolfi
#
# The following is a cumulative list of various transcription bugs
# that were fixed by hand in the INTERLN.EVT file, after conversion to
# the EVA encoding.
#
# These bug fixes affected mostly line breaking and formatting.
# The main exception is a large number of "IIIR"s in some
# transcriptions, which should have been "O"s.  Presumably they
# were caused by a coding table error somewhere.
#
# Omitted from this list are hundreds of replacements of "." by "-"
# where the text was interrupted by figures, and several dozen
# replacements of "-" by "=" (or vice-versa).
#
# The locators given here assume that the "[|]" groups were
# unfolded as explained in section <f0.U>.

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN PAGE DESCRIPTIONS
# By Jorge Stolfi 05 Dec 1998
# 
# /crease/ 
#   An *accidental* crease in the vellum (cf. /fold/).
# 
# /fold/ 
#   An *intentional* fold in the vellum, namely between 
#   panels of a fold-out.
# 
# /gutter/ 
#   The fold where a /bifolio/ is sewed to the book.
#   
# /quire/ 
#   A stack of /bifolios/ that was folded and bound as a unit. The
#   quires of the book are identified with letters `A' to to `T',
#   front to back, which may be written `qA' thru `qT' for clarity.
#   Rene Zandbergen has a detailed description of all quires and
#   bifolios.
# 
# /bifolio/ 
#   A connected piece of vellum, usually consisting of two /folios/
#   joined across the /gutter/. The notation bQK will be used to
#   denote the Kth bifolio of quire Q, counting from 1 (the outermost
#   one).
# 
# /folio/ 
#   A piece of vellum defined on one side by the gutter and three free
#   edges. In the big fold-out, the two folios (85 and 86) are
#   separated by the gutter and the vertical fold that is collinear
#   with it.
#   
# /f-number/ 
#   The standard folio number, usually written fNN where NN is the
#   original number written in the manuscript, usually at the top of
#   the /recto/ side.
#        
# /side/ 
#   One of the two surfaces of a /folio/ or /bifolio/. The sides of folio
#   fNN are denoted fNNr and fNNv, for /recto/ and /verso/, respectively.
# 
# /recto/ 
#   The /side/ of a /folio/ that you see when the /gutter/ is on the
#   left, the book is in its normal orientation, and the folio is
#   completely unfolded.
#        
# /verso/ 
#   The /side/ of a /folio/ opposite to the /recto/ side, i.e. the one
#   that you see when the /gutter/ is at right.
# 
# /free edge/ 
#   A straight section of the physical boundary of a /bifolio/.
#   
# /edge/ 
#   Either a /free edge/ or a /fold/.
# 
# /panel/ 
#   A rectangular partition of one side of a /folio/, delimited by
#   four /edges/. Thus a simple folio has two panels, recto and verso,
#   denoted by fNNr and fNNv where fNN is the folio number. In
#   fold-outs, panels are numbered fNNrK or fNNvK, starting from the
#   innermost panel (adjacent to to the gutter, K=1) and increasing
#   outwards (towards the vertical free edge of the folio). Jim Reeds
#   has a very detailed description of how the complex folios are
#   folded, including panel numbers.
# 
# /page/ 
#   One or more adjacent panels that are to be read as a unit, e.g.
#   because the contents is laid out without regards for the
#   separating edges. A page is identified by the number of its
#   innermost panel (the one that is closest to the gutter).
#   
# /contents/ 
#   Of a page, the text and drawings in it.
# 
# /margin/ 
#   Each of the four imaginary straight lines (top, bottom, left,
#   right; or North, South, West, East) that seem to bound the normal
#   text in a page. They usually lie a couple of centimeters inwards
#   relative to the panel's edges. Note that drawings and labels may
#   extend beyond the margins.
#   
# /word/ 
#   A sequence of characters (Voynichese by default) not broken by
#   /word spaces/ or graphical material.
#   
# /word space/ 
#   A space between two character that is noticebly wider than the
#   average spacing.
#   
# /text line/ 
#   A linear arrangement of characters, mostly straight or circular,
#   with their `up' directions perpendicular to the overall line
#   direction, and that (presumably) must be read consecutively. Note
#   that a text line may be /interrupted/ by graphical elements,
#   folds, vellum defects, etc.
# 
# /text ring/ 
#   A circular text line that covers almost one full circle.
#   
# /text block/ 
#   A set of two or more consecutive lines of text, stacked
#   perpendicularly to the reading direction not more than a couple of
#   character heights apart, and which presumably are to be read in
#   sequence. Note that a text block may consist of concentric
#   circular lines, and may comprise one or more /paragraphs/.
# 
# /text edge/ 
#   The two imaginary lines, not necessarily straight, that connect
#   the left end right endpoints of successive lines in a text block.
# 
# /paragraph/ 
#   A text block where the spacing between /text lines/ is uniform and
#   close to the minimum, and which presumably is a single sequence of
#   words arbitrarily broken into lines to fit the available space.
#   Typically, at least one of the text edges is straight or follows
#   the outline of an adjacent figure. The number of lines of a
#   paragraph is usually given as M.N, where M is the number of whole
#   lines, and N/10 is the width of the last line, relative to the
#   total width available for it (not counting any space taken up by
#   figures, folds, creases).
#
# /left justified/
#   (Of a text block) whose left text edge is straight and vertical.
#   
# /right justified/
#   (Of a text block) whose right text edge is straight and vertical,
#   except possibly for the last lines of paragraphs.
#   
# /label/ 
#   A short text line, containing only a couple of words, that is
#   placed next to a figure or in a cell of a diagram.
#   
# /title/ 
#   A text line that is placed next to a figure or in a cell of a
#   diagram, and is longer than a couple of words; or is placed above
#   or below a paragraph, but cannot be assumed to be part of it.
# 
# /star/ 
#   A star-shaped figure with straight sharp-pointed rays, possibly
#   with interior detail.
#   
# /tail/
#   (Of a star) a single curved line attached to the star's outline.
#
# /notched square/
#   A design often found in circular bands around diagrams. It
#   consists of a squarish sector of the band, containg four small
#   "u"s, each connected to one side by both arms. The radial sides of
#   the square are often doubled or tripled. Sometimes there are also
#   dots in the center and/or near the four corners. This design seems
#   to be used as a decoration in some diagrams (e.g. on f67v1, the
#   "happy sun" page) and as a start-of-text marker in others (e.g
#   f71r, the "Aries light" page.)
# 
# /nymph/ 
#   A human figure of female or indeterminate sex, with full or
#   partial body which may have merely a decorative or exemplary
#   purpose. E.g. the figures in the biological section, or around the
#   zodiac diagrams; but not the figures in the zodiac signs
#   themselves, or the sun/moon faces.
# 
# /breasts/
#   Visible female breasts, bare or clothed.
#
# /mechanically drawn/ 
#   The opposite of freehand. Said of straight lines that seem to have
#   been traced with ruler. Also said of circles that seem to have
#   been drawn with compass, or by tracing some round object.
#   (Jim Reeds, reporting on his Beinecke visit [13 Jul 94], says that
#   "there were no pricks or pounce marks, no rulings except
#   on the circular diagrams.")
#     
# /scales/ 
#   A common decoration motif consisting of close-packed scales with
#   rounded edge. When the fore edge of the scale-packed region is
#   visible, each scale is usually seen to have a tongue-like shape,
#   with parallel sides narrowing slightly towards the basal edge,
#   which is attached to the substrate.
#
#   This motif could represent closely-packed leaves, feathers, roof
#   tiles, flaps of fabric, etc. On one diagrams, some nymphs are
#   buried waist-deep in a field of scales, so it could be clouds,
#   grass, bushes, or a planted field. Another compelling
#   interpretation in some contexts is a layer of closely-packed seeds
#   or florets, as in corn, pomegranate, sunflower, etc.

#
# Identification:
#
#   Title: "First page"
#   Page: f1r = AA (Rene) = p001 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f1
#   Panels: f1r
#   Bifolio: bA1 = f1+f8
#   Quire: A (Rene) = I (Beinecke)
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: A (Currier)
#   Hand: 1 (Currier)
#   Subsets: T (Rene), unk (Stolfi)
#   Subject: unknown (text only).
#   Colors: red (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains four paragraphs (with 4.6, 2.4, 9.5, 5.5 lines,
#   respectively), each followed by a short right-justified title.
#
#   Paragraphs 2 and 3 begin with big "weirdo" doodles, very unlike
#   normal Voynichese letters. The first (EVA &252) looks like a
#   capital K lying on it side, with the vertical bar at the bottom.
#   The second (EVA &253) looks like the first, with an extra
#   squiggly line rising from between the two "horns". The two symbols
#   are drawn or painted with flaring strokes ending in swallowtail
#   serifs.
#
#   A 1-inch band along the right margin is heavily stained. There
#   seem to be two or three columns of letters ("key like sequences")
#   in that band, which are barely visible in the reproductions.
#
#   There is a faint unreadable text at the top of the page,
#   apparently in cursive handwriting.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The page layout suggests four quotes with attributions, or signed
#   endorsements.
#
#   The faint scribbling at the top must be the signature
#   of Jacobus de Tepenecz, as asserted in many references.
#
#   Jim Reeds writes [15 Jul 94]: "The erased key on f1r is discussed
#   by Brumbaugh. It seems to have 3 vertical columns of letters. The
#   leftmost is the ordinary alphabet, lower case italic hand, a
#   through z. I could not check for the presence of every letter (I'm
#   not sure about j, for instance) but a, b, c, ... o, p, q, r, s,
#   ... y, z are pretty clear. Next to those are very spotty frags of
#   Voynich letters. I could make out <8> next to a, <R> next to c,
#   <6> next to y, and one of the gallows letters somewhere near the
#   q, r, s range. [...] The 3d column seems to be 1 off from the
#   first: italic miniscules, r next to s, and so on. More is visible
#   in UV shots than Petersen shows."
#
#   Brumbaugh reportedly claims that there was a date in the upper
#   right corner of f1r before it was obliterated by the application
#   of chemicals (intended to reveal faded writing).
#
#   D'Imperio says that the "weirdo" characters EVA &252/&253 are in
#   bright red ink; confirmed by Glen Claston [20 Feb 1998] and Jim
#   Reeds [03 Mar 1998].
#
#   Rene [28 Jul 1997] found a medieval astrological diagram [1], in
#   Greek, where EVA &252 is used as a symbol for Aries, which is
#   "kruos" or "kryos" in Greek.
#
#   Stolfi suggested [07 Aug 1998] that the symbols may be
#   abbreviations for "Koenig" and "KoenigiN" --- i.e. "K" and
#   "K"-with-squiggle. (How desperate can you get?)

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "Petersen's belladonna"
#   Page: f1v = AB (Rene) = p002 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f1
#   Panels: f1v
#   Bifolio: bA1 = f1+f8
#   Quire: A (Rene) = I (Beinecke)
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: A (Currier)
#   Hand: 1 (Currier)
#   Subsets: H (Rene), hea (Stolfi)
#   Subject: herbal
#   Petersen's plant 1
#   Colors: green,tan (Reeds)
#   Plant: 1 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant centered on page. 
#
#     Root: a knobby, warped, pancanke-like tuber with 
#       short roots attached like claws or fangs 
#       all around the rim. Light color.
#     Stem: thick, well drawn. Light color.
#     Branches: one straight up, two oblique with drooping tips.
#     Leaves: broad lance-shape, with two short tails.
#       Stalk: short.
#     Flowers: one, growing at the tip of the center branch.  
#       Stalk: very short.  Chalyx:
#       conical, continuous with petals.  Petals: short rounded,
#       light-colored.  Core: hemispherical, dark-colored
#       (could be a berry; see below).
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.8 and 5.8 lines), just below mid-page, 
#   left- and right-justified, interrupted by the plant's main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Part of this drawing (root and leaves only) is repeated on
#   Pharma page f102r1[3,2].
#
#   The plant looks basically normal, except for the very peculiar
#   root.
#
#   Petersen identifies the plant as "Solanum Solatrium, Belladonna"
#   specifically the "flower".  He says: "see L.Fuchs p.398".  There is
#   no "Solanum solatrium"; rather, "solatrium" is an ancient
#   (Dioscoridean) name for some or all of these species:
#
#     Atropa Belladona  (deadly nightshade)
#     http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/library/kohler/1763_010.jpg
#     http://130.60.70.1/GIFTDB/pict_02.htm
#
#     Hyoscyamus niger (henbane)
#     http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/library/kohler/1763_011.jpg
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/110.html
#
#     Solanum nigrum (black nightshade)
#     http://axp.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/WEEDS/black_nightshade.html
#
#     Solanum dulcamara (bittersweet)
#     http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/poison/ppstsleurop.htm
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/109.html
#
#   and perhaps other somewhat less likely species such as Withania
#   somnifera and Physalis alkekengi. 
#
#   The leaves of f1v seem most compatible those of Atropa belladonna
#   (shape) and Hyoscyamus niger (attachment to stem), and the "flower"
#   at the top of f1v does resemble the sheathed, shiny black fruits of
#   these two species.
#
#   However, A.beladonna's root has been described as a roundish rhizome
#   with a long (up to 1m) tapering root, which does not seem to match
#   the highly distinctive "pancake with claws" of f1v.  I have found no
#   image or description of the other plants' roots.
#
#   A very similar root, with quite different leaves, can be seen on
#   another Italian herbal: 
#   University of Vermont Library MS 2, fol. 39 (ca. 1500)
#   http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/biomed/his/immi/vm9437.htm
#   The medieval text calls that plant "Gran[i]a maggiore".  
#   The modern commentary tentatively identifies it with
#   Ecballium elaterium (Squirting Cucumber), 
#   http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/mi10/mi10043.jpg 
#   However the leaves do not match, and the flower barely so.
#   I have found no image or description of E.elaterium's roots.
#
#   All four plants are poisonous in varying degrees. The active
#   principles can be absorbed by smoking or through the skin as well as
#   by ingestion.  They were used as potent psychoactive drugs, causing
#   paralysis of involuntary muscles, dizziness, sleep, hallucinations,
#   violent behavior, etc., and have been often associated with
#   witchcraft.

#
# Description:
#
#   One plant centered on page.
#
#     Root: left-right symmetrical, planar, looking sort of like 
#       headless stick man with outstretched arms and gripping hands.
#       Overpainted with dark color.
#     Stem: short and thin.
#     Branches: two main ones, almost upright, slightly bent.
#       Irregular thickness, awkward shape (cf. top right leaf).
#       Light-clored with a dark vein grossly painted along the middle.
#     Leaves: Dark overpaint, shaped like a triangular fan with five
#       lanceolated fingers. Stalk: medium length, looks like a branch.
#     Flowers: three, on tip of main branch.
#       Stalk: longish, looks like a branch.  Chalyx: an oblong oval
#       sweelling at end of stalk, partial dark overpaint.  Petals: many,
#       narrow and long; the flower looks like a shaving brush.  Core:
#       hidden by petals.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 6.4 and 5.4 lines), left- and rightjustified:
#   one at the top, slightly narrower, interrupted by three flowers;
#   and one near the bottom, interrupted by two branches.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The root looks rather strange, the stems and leaves are 
#   somewhat awkward, but the flowers look normal.
#
#   Petersen tentative identification is "cyanus segetum, cornflower
#   (caeruleus) (cf 153)".  That must be
#
#     Centaurea_cyanus (cornflower,fiodaliso;bluet,kornblume)
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/7.html
#
#   The flower shape and branching pattern seem to match fairly well.
#   However, those features are not very specific. [What about color?]
#   Also, the leaves of Centaurea cyanus are long and thin, with
#   smooth edges or a few very shallow teeth, attached directly to the
#   stem; quite unlike those of f2r.
#
#   Infusions of Centaurea cyanus were once used as a febrifugue 
#   (whole plant) and eye wash (flowers only).

# Description:
#
#   One plant centered on page. 
#
#     Root: long straight rhizome, covered with scales or round stalk scars.
#     Stem: single, vertical, slightly bent, shooting out from middle 
#       of rhizome; dark painted. 
#     Branches: there is the stub of a lost branch at mid-stalk.
#     Leaves: a single large leaf, horizontal, shaped like a very fat C,
#       with smooth rim. Painted solid dark.
#       Stalk: short.
#     Flowers: one white flower, pointing almost straight up.
#       Stalk: long, light colored, with a darker vein; part of it
#       obscured by leaf which should be behind it.  Chalyx: well-drawn,
#       with thick tongue-shaped sepals, light colored.  Petals:
#       well-drawn, flaring, lily shaped, serrated edges, white
#       underpaint.  Core: not visible.  Stamen: long, with a few short
#       hairs.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with lines, respectively), left- and
#   right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the single flower,
#   and one just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks quite natural and well-drawn.
#
#   Presumably, the flower stem was in front of the leaf in the
#   original drawing; but the dark overpaint covered it. The original
#   outline of the leaf may have been obscured, too.
#
#   The leaf shape suggests it is a water plant. With that assumption,
#   the choices are quite few. Rene suggested
#
#     Nymphaea candida (a.k.a. Nymphaea alba; water lily, seerose)

# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right margin.
#
#     Roots: a bunch of unbranched tentacle-like roots radiating from 
#       the stem's base. Light colored, partial dark overpaint.
#     Stem: rather thick, bent. Light colored, dark overpainted stripe (shadow) along
#       its left side.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: lance-shaped with an S bend, very dense, 
#       growing straight off the stem on both sides, each partially covering
#       the previous one. Stem ends with one unpaired leaf. Light colored, 
#       with a dark-painted shadow on the bottom of each leaf, and
#       a dotted line just inside the leaf's rim.
#     Flowers: none.
#
#   Four paragraphs (with 9.5, 3.5, 2.7, and 2.8 lines): a longer one
#   at the top, and three short ones just below mid-page. The first
#   two are left-justified and follow the plant's outline on the
#   right. The last two are left- and right-justified, and interrupted
#   by the main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks strange because of the dense leaves Perhaps they
#   are actually the sheaths of leafstalks, badly drawn? Perhaps the
#   dots along the leaf rim are short spines?

#
# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the bottom and right margins of the page.
#
#     Root: single long root, consisting of six "telescoping" conical
#       segments, dark painted, with flat light-painted top.  Tip of root
#       is bent into a hook and ends with a small round knob.
#     Stem: long, straight, vertical, with a dark "shadow" stripe 
#       crudely painted along its length.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: paired,  disk shaped with two "tails", two "arms", and a 
#       swallowtail-shaped "head", with long outward-curved tips. 
#       Stalks: medium length, thin.
#     Flowers: two, very unequal size, growing out of the tip of the stem.
#       Stalks: short, thin, like leaf stalks.  Calyx: heavy, swollen,
#       shaped like a sweet potato cut in half, dark painted.  Petals:
#       single row, light, semicircular, very small.  Core: flat,
#       light-colored, filled with dots; looks like a pepper shaker.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 6.0 and 7.5 lines), both in the top half of
#   the page. The text is left-justified and follows the plant outline
#   on the right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks quite strange. The telescoping root is hard to
#   explain. The leaf shape is unusual but not impossible. The bloated
#   flower chalices are very strange; they may have been drawn from
#   pressed and dried specimens.

# Comments:
#
#   Plant appearance: very, very odd, badly drawn. It seems to have
#   two types of leaves. The lower ones are too small, badly spaced
#   and badly proportioned, and in unnatural positions. The upper ones
#   look like pompons. The root has a strange, ungainly shape (but
#   that may be the work of the Dark Painter). The stems have uneven
#   and unnatural thickness.
#
#   This drawing is almost certainly an expanded version of plant
#   f101r1[1,5]. Stolfi suggested that the person who drew this page
#   thought that the star-shaped things in f101r1[1,5] were flowers,
#   so he supplied fantasy leaves; and he only noticed the mistake
#   halfway through the plant.

#   Plant: 8 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant, horizontally centered, reaching only 3/4 up the page.
#
#     Root: five unbranched roots, mostly horizontal.  Each root looks
#       like an earthworm, light-colored with a few dark dots, with a 
#       short and fat swelling about 4/5 of the way to the tip.
#     Stalk: straight, vertical, slightly tapered, uncolored(?).
#     Leaves: a single ring of large, lance shaped leaves, closely spaced, 
#       attached mid-stem with no stalks. The leaves curl down in a semicircle,
#       like an umbrella, until they almost touch the stem again; their thin
#       tips curl further into hooks. Dark overpaint.
#     Flowers: one, at tip of stem, pointing up. 
#       Stalk: medium, thin, uncolored(?); extension of stem.  Chalix:
#       thimble-shaped, partial dark overpaint.  Petals: long, hair like,
#       drooping.  Core: hemispherical, like a bubble.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.6 and 2.5 lines), both above the plant,
#   left- and right-justified.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks very strange but not impossible.  The oddest
#   details are the position of the tubers, the shape and disposition of
#   the leaves, their curled tips, the "shaggy dog" flower.

#   Plant: 9 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One branching plant that takes up the lower 3/4 of the page.
#
#     Root: two dark-painted potato-shaped tubers next to the stem,
#       with a few medium-length "mousetail" roots shooting from them.
#     Stem: straight and vertical, light under(?)color, with a fantastic
#       loop at the top. The stem's base is wrapped with a short uncolored
#       sheath.
#     Branches: several, diagonal, mostly straight.
#     Leaves: four lobes with serrated edges, naturalistically curved.
#       each lobe has a central vein. Stalks: medium-short, thin, look like 
#       branches. Light coulored, many of them with crudely overpainted
#       dark splotches.
#     Flowers: several, medium-small, mostly upright, some drooping. 
#       Stalk: short, sometimes bent by weight.  Chalyx: rounded, light
#       colored, like a rose's but on the fat side.  Sepals: short and
#       pointed, light colored.  Petals: half a dozen, small,
#       tongue-shaped, spread out; dark overpaint almost but not
#       quite fills their outline.
#
#   One paragraph (5.5 lines) above the plant, left- and
#   right-justified.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks fairly normal, except for the fantastic
#   loop in the stalk.  Leaves and flowers are very naturalistic,
#   but some are spoiled by the crude dark overpaint.

#   Petersen's plant 12
#   Colors: green,tan (Reeds)
#   Plant: 12 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant with no leaves and a single huge flower, spanning the
#   entire height and width of the page.
#
#     Root: a short, vertical, cylindrical stem that splits
#       into two almost horizontal mousetails.
#     Stem: straight, vertical.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: none.
#     Flowers: a single flower at the tip of the stem.
#       Stalk: not visible, or indistinguishable from stem.
#       Chalyx: eight symmetrical sepals, shaped like long parabolas.
#       Corolla: four layers, of decreasing sizes, each having four 
#         symmetric petals, located diagonally with respect to 
#         the previous layer.  Core: none.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 4.3 lines and 4.5 lines), both left- and
#   right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the flower; one
#   just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Petersen has identified this plant with high confidence
#   as 
#
#     Nymphaea alba (white water lily, seerose)
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/181.html
#     http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/nymphaea/nymph/nympcan2.jpg
#
#   There is indeed a good match in the shape and arrangement of the
#   petals and sepals. Also, the lack of leaves and branches in f7v is
#   plausibly explained by the fact that Nymphaea's flowers float on
#   the water's surface, and thus may have been hidden from the
#   artist's view.
#
#   But if f7v is Nymphaea alba, then what do we make of f2v?

# Description:
#
#   One plant with a single, big, odd-shaped leaf and a "collar"
#   around its stem, horizontally centered and spanning the page 
#   vertically from edge to edge.
#
#   Three paragraphs (with 6.5, 3.6, 6.6 lines), left- and
#   right-justified and interrupted by the plant's stem, fill up the
#   bottom 3/4 of the page. Each paragraph is followed by a
#   right-justified two-word title.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant is very strange, bot for the leaf shape and for the 
#   "collar" around the stem.  Perhaps it is a mushroom (e.g. Amanita),
#   which the artist mistook for a plant and tried to draw as such?
#
#   The text format too is quite unusual, both in its length and in 
#   the presence of titles.

#   Plant: 17 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right and bottom edges, reaching
#   almost to the top.
#
#     Root: a bundle of thin wires. Dark overpaint?
#     Stem: one straight. Light color.
#     Branches: two symmetrical pairs, oblique.
#     Leaves: the four lower ones are medium width, lance-shaped,
#       with smooth edges; the others have the same outline but
#       are deeply cut into five narrow points.  Dark color.
#       Stalk: short, mostly missing.
#     Flowers: five, at the tips of stem and branches.
#       Stalk: medium length, thin. Chalyx: flat or everted, with short
#       triangular sepals, partly hidden by corolla.  Petals: five rounded
#       petals, a large one on top, the others like "arms and legs". Core:
#       very small. Medium and dark colors.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.7 and 7.7 lines) at the top,
#   left-justified. The first one is right-justified; the second one
#   follows the plant's profile on the right. Both are interrupted in
#   several places by the flowers and leaves.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Petersen identifies this plant, with high confidence, as "Viola
#   trinitalis".  I coudn't find such species, but "herba trinitatis" is
#   the herbalists' name for Viola tricolor (heartsease,wild pansy) [1,2,3].
#
#   Indeed, comparing f9v with a drawing by Carl Lindman [1], we see
#   an almost perfect match --- including the roots, and the two types
#   of leaves.
#
#   Dennis Mardle [10 Oct 1998] observes that the details match also
#   Viola arvensis (field pansy), which hybridises with V. tricolor
#   and is very similar in shape, including especially the dimorphic
#   leaves [1,4].
#
#   The colors may help resolve this issue. The flowers of Viola
#   tricolor are usually purple and white with yellow core; Lindman's
#   drawing shows V. arvensis as white (or light blue?) with yellow
#   core. Jim Reeds color list [03 Mar 1998] reports some blue on this
#   page, to be confirmed.
#
#   In either case, there is one odd detail: the flowers in f9v are
#   upside-down.  Also the two bottom flowers are somewhat differen.
#
#   Viola tricolor was used internally to treat epilepsy, asthma and
#   bronchitis (whole plant), as an emetic and purgative (seeds) and as
#   a heart tonic (flowers). Externally it was used to treat skin
#   diseases [2].  The flowers are reported to be edible.

#
#   Two paragraphs (with 6.0 and 6.8 lines) at the top,

#
#   There is a mark at the SE corner, not fully visible in the image.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark at the SE corner is almost surely the quire number, "2nd"
#   in abbreviated Latin.

#   Folio: f17
#   Panels: f17r

#
# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right margin,
#   spanning from the bottom edge to a little below the top
#   margin.
#
#   Three paragraphs (with 2.6, 2.5, 5.5 lines) at the top, left- and
#   right-justified except for the last paragraph (which follows the
#   plant's outline on the right), extending down to mid-page.
#   Paragraph 3 may actually be two paragraphs (with 2.9 and 2.5
#   lines).
#   
#   There is one extra line of text above the top margin (unit
#   f17r.H), apparently not in the same hand as the rest of the page.
#   The letters are smalled than normal; some of them resemble
#   Voynichese charactersthey, others look more like Latin. One of the
#   legible characters is an EVA "y" with macron; another, less
#   legible, could be an EVA "r". The right half of the line is almost
#   completely erased, and may extend beyond the normal right margin;
#   the left half is not quite readable.
#  
# Comments:
#
#   The extra line of text at the top of the page looks similar to the
#   hand of f116v (especially the characters shaped like "l"s). The
#   letters are probably Latin, or possibly Greek; the EVA-"y" with macron
#   would then be an abbreviation.
#
#   The eyes in the roots seem to be the result of "enhancing" two
#   eye-like gaps in the roots.
#
## <f17r.H> {}
# Extraneous writing at the top (almost certainly not Voynichese).

# In this file, the alignment between the right and left halves of the
# second paragraph is based on line count, even though the lines on
# the right are shifted down by a varying amount (from 0.5 to 1.5
# baseline spacing). The misalignment is indicated by "{\} comments.
#
# The original C and F transcriptions used an alignment based on line
# position, where the right half of lines 4 through 9 were shifted
# down one line, with the spill over being transcribed as line 10.
#
# A case could be made for the two halves being independent paragraphs.

#   Plant: 75 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant flush against the left, right and bottom edges of the page, 
#   filling the bottom half of the page.
#
#     Root: a very broad tuber, like a fat pancake with flat light
#       upper surface and dark edge.  A ring of 19 "fat mousetail" roots---
#       dark, short and S-shaped---sprout from the edge; they seem
#       to support the "pancake" like the legs of a table.
#     Stem: many short straight stems sprout separately from the top surface
#       of the "pancake". Each stem ends with a leaf.
#     Branches: occasional short branches, each having a 
#       single leaf at the tip.
#     Leaves: two spindle-shaped leaves fused at the base, forming a 
#       "V" with fat arms and pointed tips.  No leaf stalks.
#     Flowers: a single flower.
#       Stalk: longish.  Chalyx: spindle-shaped, with small triangular
#       sepals.  Petals: seven small scale-shaped petals.  Core: small.
#
#   There are three paragraphs of text (with 4.3, 3.4, 5.9 lines)
#   above the plant, flush against the top margin. Below the third one
#   there is a centered line with 4-5 words; it may be part of the
#   paragraph. The first two paragraphs span margin-to-margin; the
#   last one is even on the left, and extends right up to the plant's
#   outline on the right, even touching it.
#
# Comments:
#
#   An almost identical copy of this drawing appears on f95r2. The
#   drawing on this page is drawn with more skill, and the flowers are
#   more detailed. The root is flatter, and its upper surface is
#   ligher. Also the flowers sprout from the side of the stem, not
#   from its tip as in f95r2.

# Description:
#
#   There is a mark at the SE corner, resembling a "7" (uncrossed, with
#   upturned serif on the top stroke) with a superscript "cg".
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark at the SE corner is almost surely a quire number, a digit
#   with a Latin abbreviation. 
#
#   Landini's comments say "gathering mark 5". But it looks more 
#   like a "seven" to me...

# Description:
#
#   There is a marking at the SE corner, resembling a "6"
#   with a superscript "cg".
#
#   There seems to be a faint image to the left of the leftmost flower.
#   It is neither an imprint from f47v nor a bleedthrough from f48v.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark at the SE corner is almost certainly the quire number,
#   "6th" in abbreviated Latin.

#
# Description:
#
#   A large plant, flush against the right and bottom edges,
#   and reaching almost to the top margin.
#
#     Root: four dark teardrop-shaped tubers.
#     Stem: single, straight vertical, with dark streaks.
#     Branches: not visible.
#     Leaves: roundish, with scalloped margins.
#       Painted solid dark. Stalk: long and drooping.
#     Flowers: three open flowers and many buds, sprouting from two
#       sinuous, drooping branches; ome uncolored, most painted dark.
#       Stalk: short. Chalix: spherical, with a short trumpet
#       of fused sepals ending with a scalloped edge.  Petals: 
#       longish in the open flowers, resembling a diver's paddle foot with three 
#       fingers, painted dark; folded into the chalyx in 
#       the immature buds. Core, stamens, and pistils: not visible.
# 
#   Tunneling through the tubers are two animals that could be
#   snakes or earthworms: legless, with long, sinuous bodies
#   ending with a rounded tail.  Their head resembles that of 
#   a sea horse, and both have a row of dots along the back.
#
#   There are three paragraphs (with 3.0, 7.6, 9.6 lines).
#   The first one, squeezed above the plant, is left- and 
#   (roughly) right-justified.  The other two, that lie 
#   between 1/4 and 3/4 of the page's vertical extent, 
#   are left-justified, and follow the plant's outline at right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The head and snout details of the snakes resemble those of the
#   "baby dragon" in f???.  There is a resemblance also to the fishes
#   in the Pisces symbol (f???) and the birds in the "Garden of Eden"
#   page (f???).
#
#   It is not clear how the "snakes" are related to the plant.

#   The top 3/4 of the page are occupied by three paragraphs of text

#
#   To the left of each text line there is a single symbol, 26 in

#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost surely the quire number,
#   "7th": the "lambda" is a "7", and the "j" in the superscript is
#   actualy an EVA "y" with macron, a scribal abbreviation for "-us".

# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram. 
#
#   Eight concentric mechanically drawn circles delimit four text
#   rings, which are divided into 4 quadrants by straight lines in
#   the NE, NW, SW, and SE directions. The lines are drawn with ruler,
#   but do not quite meet at the center (They may be modern additions
#   to the copy). there is an isolated word outside the outer circle.
#
#   At the center is a simple rosette, with 4 short and 4 long rounded
#   lobes, with a circle and a dot in the middle.
#
#   Inside the inner circle there are four naked human figures,
#   visible from the chest up, heads towards the center.
#   Two are male, two female; two are seen mostly from the front
#   two mostly from the back; two have both arms raised, two have 
#   only one.  Here are the combinations:
#
#     North:  male,   back,  two arms straight in "V".
#     West:   female, front, one arm straight at 45 degrees.
#     South:  female, back,  two arms straight in "V".
#     East:   male,   front, one arm forward then bent up, holding a ball.
#
#   There are 8 words inside the inner circle. Four of them radiate
#   from the rosette, roughly along the diagonal lines.  The other
#   four are tangential (but with straight baselines), to be read
#   in the clockwise direction; it is not clear whether they
#   label the four figures, or the spaces between them.

# Description:
#
#   The page contains three long text blocks with 14.5, 9.7, 15.7
#   lines, with clear gaps between them. There are hints of paragraph
#   breaks inside each block, but they are not evident. The three
#   paragraphs are left- and right-justified, except that the first
#   three lines are indented as if making space for an ornate capital.
#
#   There are three stars in the left margin, with 6, 7, and 7 points,
#   respectively. Each star is positioned just above the corresponding
#   paragraph. The last two starts have a small circular core.

#
# Description:
#
#   The text is laid out in 3 columns. For each line:
#
#     The left-most column contains either a single Voynich ``word'' or is blank.
#     The middle column contains a single single ``character'' or a ligature.
#     The right column contains a line of what appears to be normal Voynich text.
#
#   The text on the right is laid out in paragraphs i.e. most lines are about the
#   same length, occasionally there is a shorter line (with blank space to the
#   right) followed by some vertical blank space before the next paragraph
#   starts.
#
#   In the top right hand corner there is a number "66" in ordinary numerals.
#
#   In the bottom left hand corner, there is a picture of a woman
#   lying down on her back (dead?). To the left of the woman are two
#   circles and a cylinder. Above her are four words in Voynich text.
#   To the far left are four words in a different hand and a different
#   alphabet. To me they look like:
#
#       v
#   Den  mv<illegible>
#      der
#
#   In the bottom right hand corner there is a symbol that looks like a number 2
#   on its side.
#
#   Here is a schematic layout of the text. Let
# 
#    L: left hand column
#    M: second column
#    R: right hand text
#    W: text above female figure

#   Subject: herbal
#   Colors: blue,yellow,brown (Reeds)
#   Plant: 116 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant occupies the bottom 2/3 of the page. 
#
#     Roots: four thin stalks, arcing down, each ending with a tuber shaped like
#       a chili pepper pod. The tubers are almost horizontal, pointing outwards,
#       and resemble four feet wearing pointy shoes.
#     Stem: short and thick, dark-painted very crudely .
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: each leaf consists of a dense stack of parallel leaflets.
#       curled inwards.  The distal leaflets are bigger, so that the leaf
#       is shaped like a truncated cone, with the narrow end down.  
#       Very weird-looking. Alternate leaflets are dark-painted.
#       Stalks: about as long as the stem, slightly S-shaped.
#     Flowers: two, one on each side.
#       Stalks: medium long, thin, slightly curve, branching off
#       diagonally from each the leaf axilla.  Chalix: olive-shaped,
#       with short, flaring, triangular sepals; medium-dark.
#       Petals: triangular, dark.  Core: not visible.
#
#   Above the plant there are three paragraphs (with 4.6, 2.8, 4.9
#   lines, respectively), flush with the top, left, and right margins.
#   The last line is interrupted by the plant.
#   
#   There is a faint scribbling to the left of the root. It looks like
#   an illegible word surmounted by a large EVA "l", followed by a very
#   crude stick man with rectangular head and eyes, wearing two
#   superimposed EVA "l"s as a hat.
#
#   The bottom edge of the page has an indentation, about 1cm deep
#   near the middle of the edge, extending from there to the SW corner. 
#
#   There is a mark in the SE corner, resembling "8" with superscript 
#   "ug".
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks very strange and inelegant, it was very poorly
#   drawn.
#
#   Since the roots barely touch the edge of this tear, without
#   crossing it, we can presume that the the defect was already there
#   when the plant was drawn..
#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost surely the quire number, "8th"
#   in abbreviated Latin.

#
#   This is the innermost recto panel of a four-panel fold-out.
#   There seems to be some confusion in the page numbering in this fold-out;
#   it is also listed as page 120.

#
# Description:
#
#   The page is dominated by a circular diagram, surmounted by a single 
#   paragraph of text (4 lines).
#
#   The diagram is framed by three rings of text, delimited by 
#   four thin circles.  All three rings are broken at 11:30
#   by two radial strokes and a decorated design.
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is a cicle of small "pearls",
#   containing a woman's(?) face, with crossed eyes and a bored or
#   displeased look. The space between them is dark (hair? shadow?).
#
#   This small circle is surrounded by elongated triangular spikes, painted
#   solid dark, forming a 12-pointed star.  The gaps between consecutive
#   spikes are filled by kite-shaped regions, with the sharp corner pointing inward.
#   The result is another "fat" star with 12 chubby points and finely serrated outlines.
#   Each "kite" is split along its diagonal; the clockwise half is painted
#   solid dark, the other one is filled with little stars.  
#
#   The space between the "fat star" and the outer circle is divided into
#   24 sectors, containing alternately a label and one or two stars.
#   (The "star" sectors are those aligned with the starry half-kites.)
#
#   In the SE corner there is a mark resembling a "9" with "ng" superscript.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The central face probably represents the moon.
#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost certainly the quire number,
#   "9th" in abbreviated Latin.

#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram, defined by 7 concentric mechanically drawn
#   circles.
#
#   Circles 1 and 2 (from the outside in) define a narrow band of
#   decoration, consisting of 24 copies of a "scroll"-like or
#   "resistor"-like object. Circles 3 and 4 define another narrow
#   empty band; same for circles 6 and 7.
#
#   Between circles 2 and 3 there is a band of coloured (red?) text,
#   consisting of 12 phrases separated by wide gaps (unit "Y"). They
#   don't line up perfectly with inner sectors (see below), but appear
#   to be spaced as if the intent was there.
#
#   Between circles 4 and 5 there is a broad band, divided into 12
#   sectors by straight radial lines, unevenly spaced. Each sector
#   contains two or three lines of text, reading clockwise, with straight
#   or curved baselines (unit "C").  
#
#   Near the bottom (innner) edge of each sector there is a round moon
#   with crescent shadow and human face. Seven of the moons have a
#   label just above (i.e. outwards of) them (unit "L").
#
#   This table shows the number of lines in units "C" and "L" and the
#   moon colours (light/medium/dark), starting from 08:30:
#
#     O'clock   08: 09: 10: 11:   00: 01: 02: 03:   04: 05: 06: 07: (+:30)
#     Number    #01 #02 #03 #04   #05 #06 #07 #08   #09 #10 #11 #12
# 
#     C lines   3.5 2.0 3.0 3.0   2.5 2.0 2.0 2.0   2.0 3.0 3.0 3.0
#     L labels  --  lab --  lab   --  lab lab lab   lab --  --  lab
#     colours   lt  dk  lt  dk    md  dk  lt  lt    dk  dk  lt  dk 
#
#   Between circles 5 and 6 there is a single row of text, containing 12
#   labels (unit "X"), apparently associated with the sectors and/or
#   moons in the band above.
#
#   Inside circle 7 there is another ring of text, with 8 erratically spaced
#   labels (unit "Z").
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is an eight-pointed star/flower
#   with an "orange slice" background.  The eight arms are not
#   particularly aligned with the 8 labels of the innermost text circle.
#   The star arm at 08:30 has a dotted tail extending out between two
#   labels.
#
#   Below the diagram there is a normal-looking paragraph (unit "P")
#   with 3.0 lines. According to John Grove these are only lines in
#   the MS that are ruled.  The center line of text is coloured (red?)
#   and its strokes seem to be heavier than those of the other two.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It is possible that the text in all the sectors between radial
#   lines 10:00 and 5:00 comprises a single paragraph with three and a
#   half lines. The same can be said of the remaining sectors.
#
#   Robert Firth once suggested that the seven named moons may be the
#   the seven Ptolemaic planets.
#
#   Since line 2 of the paragraph is colored, each line is probably
#   a separate sentence.

# It may be that lines 27-32 and 1-11 constitute a single paragraph
# with two lines and half, and ditto for lines 12-26. However, the
# 08:30 sector has four lines, whereas 07:30 has three and 09:30 has
# two. So the reading order used below (by sector) is probably the

#   Title: "Four constellations with faces"
#   Page: f67v2 = IC (Rene) = p121 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f67
#   Panels: f67v2
#   Bifolio: bI1 = f67+f68

#
#   This is the outermost verso panel of a four-panel fold-out.
#
#   Machine-translated by Roe, 6th September 1993 from transcription in
#   Bennett notation dated April 1990.
#
#   This is plate XX in Newbold, and plate IV in Manly31. Newbold's
#   folio number scheme has this as 67r.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: C (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: cosmological
#   Colors: green,red,yellow,blue (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram with four smaller circular medallions touching
#   it at the NE, SE, SW and NW corners.
#
#   The main diagram is framed by a band delimited by two faint,
#   concentric, mechanically drawn circles, centered on the page. The
#   outer circle touches the vertical edges of the page.
#
#   Between these two circles there are four "captions", North, South,
#   East and West (text units "C1", "C2", "C3", and "C4",
#   respectively), each in two short lines, reading clockwise.
# 
#   In the center of the large diagram there is an irregular square,
#   within which is inscribed another circle, within which is a star
#   with 6 or 7 arms. The space between the star and the circle is
#   filled with "spiral galaxy" hatching, whose "arms" bend
#   counterclockwise-out. There are two words above the square
#   (unit "S1") and another two below it (unit "S2").
#
#   From the square, lines radiate out in the E, S, W, and N
#   directions. Each of these four lines is labeled (units "L1"
#   through "L4") and terminates with a branching structure.
#
#   Lines come in towards the square from the perimeter of the large
#   circle in the NW, NE, SE and SW direction. Each of these four
#   lines is labeled (units "L5" through "L8") and terminates with a
#   branching structure. Nested in these structures are two suns (NW
#   and SE) and two moons (NE and SW), all with faces.
#
#   The small circles in the corners contain between three and four
#   human faces, joined by lines. NE circle: four faces connected by a
#   cross, and one label (unit "F2"). SE circle: four faces, in "L"
#   pattern (with the second face centered on the vertical and wearing
#   a pointy hat), and one label (unit "F1"). SW circle: four faces at each
#   point of a square "U", on a coloured background; the two on the
#   bottom of the "U" are upside down. (John Grove speculates that
#   there is a fourth face hidden behind the first one on L5). NW
#   circle: three circular faces with one face on each point of a
#   reversed "4".
#
# Comments:
#
#   This is the folio Newbold claimed showed an annular eclipse. See
#   also John Manley's 1931 article in Speculum: ``Furthermore, I
#   invite the reader to examine carefully Plate IV and say whether it
#   bears any resemblance whatever to an annular eclipse.''

#   Panels: f67v1
#   Bifolio: bI1 = f67+f68

#   Language: ? (Currier)

#   Subsets: A (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: astronomical
#   Colors: yellow(most_stars),green(some_stars) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram. At the center there is
#   a large sun with 18 narrow undulating rays (with two of them
#   joined; see below). The sun has a face with a short "frame" beard,
#   broad smile, crossed eyes, a skullcap. At the temples, two locks
#   of light wavy hair escape from under the cap.
#
#   There are 17 short titles radiating out of the center, towards the
#   diagram's outer frame (unit "Y"). Each of these radial titles
#   starts near the tip of a sun ray, except for the title at 02:00,
#   which is connected by thin wavy lines to the tips of two sun rays,
#   at 02:00 and 02:30. The text reads outwards, so it is upside down
#   from 06:30 through 11:30.
#
#   In each sector between consecutive radial titles there are from
#   one to four stars, 39 in total. Clockwise from the double sun ray,
#   the counts per sector are
#
#                     *                
#     *             * *     * *        
#     * *   * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     3 2 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2
#
#   Around the diagram there is a narrow band divided into segments, 6
#   at the top and 6 at the bottom. The band has wide gaps at left and
#   right, where it gets too near the margin. Each segment contains a
#   label enclosed in a decorative frame (unit "X"). 
#
# Comments:
#
#   The double ray may be where the stext starts. This guess is
#   supported by the line-initial EVA "p". (There is another "p" at
#   04:15 and an "f" at 06:30, but they are not line-initial.)
#
#   It is not certain that the labels in the outer band are
#   associated with the rays.  The gap on the left side is 
#   definitely empty, and that on the right appears to be so.
#   Thus there are only 12, or at most 14, labels in the band.
#
#   The decoration in the outer band includes 24 copies of the
#   "notched square" symbol, with double vertical edges.

#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram surmounted by a paragraph
#   with 3.5 lines (unit "P"). 
#
#   The diagram consists of a faint circular outline filled with 
#   29 randomly placed stars, each with a label (unit "S"). 
#
#   At the top and bottom of the diagram, just inside the outline, there
#   are two smaller circular medallions.
#
#   The top medallion (the Sun) sports a ring of fang-shaped rays.
#   Inside it is the face of a woman, with short curly hair and
#   crossed eyes; and three voynichese words (unit "X").
#
#   The bottom medallion is framed by a circular band with some text
#   (unit "Y"). Inside the frame is the face of a man(?), also with
#   crossed eyes, apparently with short hair and a "frame" beard, both
#   dark.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The two medallions presumably represent the Sun and Moon. Compare
#   this diagram with the following one (f68r2), which is visible at
#   the right when the foldout is open.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "Moon over Sun"
#   Page: f68r2 = IF (Rene) = p124 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f68
#   Panels: f68r2
#   Bifolio: bI1 = f67+f68
#   Quire: I (Rene) = IX (Beinecke)
#
#   This is the second-innermost recto panel of an eight-panel fold-out.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: A (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: astronomical
#   Colors: yellow(most_stars),blue(some_stars) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram centered on the page, surmounted by a paragraph
#   with 5.0 lines (unit"P"). The bottom line is interrupted by the
#   diagram.
#
#   The diagram is framed by a large ring of 23 unlabeled stars. The
#   ring is divided into two arcs with 11 stars on the left, 12 on the
#   right.
#
#   The starry ring is filled with 36 stars of various sizes, all bigger
#   than the border stars, randomly placed. Of them, 24 (perhaps 25)
#   have a label (unit "S").
#
#   At the top, within the large circle, is a smaller circle with a
#   human face and moon-like shadow in the middle, and a ring of
#   Voynich text around the circumference (unit "U"). The moon has a human face
#   with neutral expression.
#
#   At the bottom, within the large circle, is a smaller circle with a
#   sun in the middle and a ring of Voynich text around the
#   circumference (unit "L"). The sun has a human face, with some hair
#   over the temple.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The two medallions presumably represent the Sun and Moon. Compare
#   this diagram with the previous one (f68r1), which is visible at
#   the left when the foldout is open.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "The Pleiades"
#   Page: f68r3 = IG (Rene) = p125 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f68
#   Panels: f68r3 + f68r4
#   Bifolio: bI1 = f67+f68
#   Quire: I (Rene) = IX (Beinecke)
#
#   This page comprises the two outermost recto panels (f68r3 and f68r4) 
#   of an eight-panel fold-out.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: A (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: astronomical
#   Colors: yellow(stars) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram, centerd on the page. The diagram is framed by
#   a band of text (unit "C1") between two faint mechanically drawn
#   circles, with no distinguished gap.
#
#   At the center there is a bored-looking round face, surrounded by a
#   band of text (unit "C2").
#
#   The space between the inner and outer bands is divided into eight
#   sectors by radial text lines---vertical, horizontal, and at 45
#   degrees (unit "R"). All lines read inward, so some are
#   upside-down.
#
#   Sectors 11:00, 02:00, 05:00, and 08:00 are filled with unnamed stars.
#
#   Sectors 10:00, 01:00, 04:00, and 07:00 contain respectively 1, 2,
#   3, and 4 stars, each with a label (unit "X"). Sector 10:00 contains
#   also a 7-star cluster, with a single label (line "X.1").
#
#   A curved line ("tail") connects the cluster to the moon at the center;
#   it too has a label (line "X.2").
#
# Comments:
#
#   The face probably represents the Moon. It seems to be a woman.
#
#   The seven-star cluster can only be the Pleiades. So perhaps
#   "doaro" means "Pleiades" in Voynichese?

#
# Description:
#
#   The page is dominated by a circular diagram, su surmounted by a 
#   paragraph of text (3.5 lines).
#
#   The diagram is framed by a ring of text, between two very faint
#   mechanically drawn circles. A large gap in the text, with a
#   decoration element, is very likely the starting point.
#
#   At the center there is a circle framed by another ring of text,
#   also between two faint circles. The interior is divided into three
#   parts by an upside-down "T". The top quarters contain a word each;
#   the bottom half contains three lines of text. The circles and the
#   "T" are mechanically drawn.
#
#   Surrounding the central circle is an irregular "ocean" with a dotted
#   texture and a meandering outline.  The outline is doubled in places
#   in a way that suggests a sunken pond, or a shape cut out 
#   from thick cardboard.
#
#   Eight hand-drawn, inward-reading text bands, curved like the
#   "arms" of a galaxy, connect the outer frame of the diagram with
#   the center figure. The four arms that start at mid-quadrant merge
#   into the "ocean", while the other four continue over the ocean and
#   merge with the inner circle of text, 45 degrees counterclockwise
#   of their starting point on the outer circle.
#
#   The four arms that connect to the center divide the "ocean" into
#   four sectors. Each sector contains five unnamed stars, except the
#   West sector, that has six of them. (The anomaly may have to do with
#   the fact that one of the six stars is right on top of the fold-out's
#   crease.)
#
# Comments:
#
#   The outline of the "galactic bulge" seems to
#   represent water in other illustrations. Here the ocean's outline is
#   drawn with a displaced "echo", as if it were a pool, or a thick
#   puzzle piece.

# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, under a paragraph 
#   with 5.0 lines (unit "P").  The last line is interrupted
#   by the diagram.
#
#   The diagram is framed by a circular band of text (unit "C"),
#   between two concentric mechanically drawn thin circles. (An
#   extra-wide gap at 10:30 may be the starting point.)
#
#   At the center there is a figure that looks pretty much like a
#   flower, with eight almond-shaped petals. The petals have serrated
#   edges, and overlap randomly. (However some pairs of petals seem to
#   be fused.)  The petals have been painted in a dark color.
#
#   At the very center of this "flower" there is an irregular star,
#   with twisted rays, in a different color.
#
#   The "flower"'s outline ia an eight-sided star, resembling two
#   concentric squares rotated 45 degrees apart.  From the tips
#   of each "petal", there sprouts a straight narrow tendril.
#   Each tendril soon turns into a radial text line, reading outwards
#   (unit "R").  Some of the text is therefore upside down.
#
#   The eight sectors defined by these rays alternately contain a
#   bunch of unnamed stars, or two radial labels (unit "S"), collinear
#   and reading outwards, with a single star between them. Clockwise
#   from the division at 11:30 there are 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1 stars,
#   i.e. 35 unlabeled ones and 4 labeled ones.  The 03:00 sector (with 8
#   stars) has a speckled blotch behind and between two stars.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The small central flower may be the Sun. Or it may represent the
#   stamens/pistils of the large flower surrounding it.
#
#   The speckles in the 03:00 sector possibly represent a more distant
#   star cluster.
#
#   The radial lines should probably be read starting from 10:30, at
#   the gap in the outer text ring. Besides, that ray is the only one
#   that contains any EVA "p" (two of them).

#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by two faint
#   mechanically drawn circles, each surrounded by a ring of text.
#
#   The whole is surrounded by another thin circle, about 1cm further
#   out, that begins looking mechanically drawn but at some point
#   wanders off and fails to close on itself, as if the fixed leg of the
#   compass had skipped a bit. (However, this outermost circle may be a
#   modern scribble on the copy.)
#
#   A thick radial stroke at 10:30 connects this outermost circle to the
#   next one, through the gap between two words of the outer text ring.
#   Another pair of thick radial strokes at 10:00 connects the second
#   and third circles, breaking the second text ring.
#
#   At the center of the diagram is a sun, with narrow flipped
#   S-shaped rays and a human face (with neutral expression, straight
#   hair combed back at the sides, held by a narrow headband with
#   dots.)
#
#   Surrounding the sun is a "starry windmill": a fat star with
#   serrated outline, consisting of 16 sectors shaped like narrow
#   kites, each split radially into a "light" (clockwise) half, with a
#   dotted line and some small stars, and a "dark" half, painted with
#   a solid dark color. Clockwise from the 10:00 point, the light
#   half-sectors contain the following counts of stars:
#
#     4 4 4 3 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 5 5 5 
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * *   * * * * * * * * * * * *
#                 * * * * * * * * * *
#                   * * * * * *      
#                         * *        
#
#   All told there are 66 stars. (But the star count of 7 in the 06:30
#   sector may be an 8.
#
#   Thin radial lines connect each point of the star to the 
#   inner edge of the frame. The 16 sectors defined by these lines
#   are alternatingly filled with unnamed stars, or labeled with
#   a radial text line, reading outwards.  Clockwise from the 
#   10:00 ray, the sectors contain the following counts: 
#
#     8 7 7 8 9 9 8 7
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     *     * * * *    
#             * *        
#
#   There are 63 stars in total.
# 
#   There is a comet-tail-like object behind one of the stars in 
#   the 03:00 sector.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It is not clear whether the "start here" strokes at 10:00-10:30
#   are original, or modern guesses scribbled on the copy. If the
#   latter, then they seem wrong, because those word gaps are quite
#   ordinary and not aligned.
#
#   Another possible starting place is at 01:15, where both rings have
#   aligned, extra-wide word breaks.
#
#   On the other hand, the EVA "p" on the the 10:30 radial line suggests 
#   that that is indeed the first line.
#
#   The center figure is probably female.
#
#   Note that the small and large star counts are almost the same (67
#   and 63); perhaps 64 was the intended number. Note also that the
#   small star counts are unimodal. The big star counts would be
#   unimodal too if the 11:00 sector had 7 stars, or the 09:30 sector
#   had 8. The latter seems more likely as it would have bumped the
#   number of big stars to 64. In both sequences the minimum is around
#   01:10 (the aligned breaks!) and the maximum around 07:00.
#
#   The "tail" in the 03:00 sector may mean that one of the stars is a comet.

# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, under a single paragraph 
#   (unit "P") with 3.9 lines.
#
#   The diagram is bounded by a faint mechanically drawn circle. Just
#   inside it is a circular band of text (unit "C"), reading clockwise.
#   This text is divided into 16 sectors; see below for details.
#
#   Most of the area inside the diagram is occupied by a flower-like
#   figure. The core of the flower is a thin mechanically drawn
#   circle, containing a star with six narrow, pointed arms. Each arm
#   has three coloured bands near the point.
#
#   The rays of the star divide the interior of the circle into six
#   unequal sectors, each labeled with a Voynichese letter (unit "W").
#   There is no obvious starting place.
#
#   Surrounding the central disk is a band of text (unit "S"), with a
#   discernible gap at 10:00. Surrounding the text is another thin
#   mechanically drawn circle, slightly eccentric.
#
#   Sprouting from the second circle are 45 thin radial lines ("flower
#   stalks"), extending almost all the way to the outer text band, each
#   of them terminating in an object that looks like a shallow conical
#   cup (perhaps a stylized flower, resembling a California poppy).
#   The "flowers" touch each other, forming a continuous ring. 
#
#   The 45 sectors defined by the flower stalks are alternatingly
#   "empty" and filled with 22 radial lines of text (unit "R"),
#   reading outwards. This leaves two adjacent empty sectors at 02:00.
#   The first of these two empty sectors (going clockwise) is cut by
#   an extra radial line that passes between the two flower cups and
#   extends all the way to the outer circle. The clockwise half of
#   this sector is is decorated with abstract patterns.
#
#   Some of the "empty" sectors have a stripe of dark paint, displaced
#   to one side. There are 12 dark stripes, starting with the 3rd
#   sector after the decorated "marker", and then spaced
#
#     2,4,4,2,4,6,2,4,6,2,4
#
#   sectors apart (always clockwise).
#
#   The space between the "ring of flowers" and the outer circle is
#   divided into sixteen sectors by another set of radial lines, thin
#   and wavy. These lines divide the outer band of text into sixteen
#   phrases, each containing a few whole words. One of these lines is
#   the extra radial line at 02:00, that defined the decorated band.
#   The other fifteen lines start at the flower ring, either between
#   two adjacent flowers (13 cases) or at the middle of a flower (2
#   cases). These lines thus divide the "flower ring" too into
#   sections, which, clockwise from the "start marker" line contain
#
#     2, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.5, 3.5, 3, 3, 2, 3
#
#   flower cups.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The dark stripes in some sectors may have been the result of the
#   hypothetical "Dark Painter" mistaking the spaces between the
#   radial lines by solid cylinders, and tried to shade them
#   accordingly. Unfortunately that "obvious" interpretation is
#   excluded when one looks closely at how the radial lines connect to
#   the "cups".  Of course the "shadows" have made the error easier to
#   make.
#
#   There is no obvious place to start reading the letters between 
#   the star arms; but if one starts at 11:00 (the smallest sector)
#   the letters spell out "dolsedy"; which may be an unexpected
#   splitting of "dolshdy", a rather common word.
#
#   The radial lines and the outer text probably start at the
#   decorated band at 02:00. On the other hand, the decorated band may
#   be just a filler addded to patch up a mistake (the attempt to fit
#   an alternating pattern into an odd number of sectors).

# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by four faint
#   circles alternating with three bands of text (unit "C"). There is
#   a conspicuous extra-wide break in all three bands at 10:45. There
#   are also a couple of 'double space'd gaps in all three rings at
#   about 12:00, not quite aligned, following the first few words on
#   each ring.
#
#   In the middle of the diagram there is a colored disk filled with
#   tiny stars, with one large star at the center, whose slender rays
#   extend to the disk's perimeter.
#
#   Sprouting radially from the disk are 28 cylindrical objects
#   ("logs"), alternatingly long and short, extending about halfway to
#   the outer frame. Each log has a label (unit "L"), which reads
#   radially inward along the log's axis.

#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by three faint
#   mechanically drawn circles and three rings of text (unit "C").
#
#   The first ring of text lies just inside circle #1 (the outermost
#   one). Only the top half of the ring is filled, and mostly with
#   dots and circles; the text proper is only a couple of words.
#
#   Text rings #2 and #3 lie just outside circles #2 and #3. There are
#   extra-wide word gaps at about 10:30, not aligned, and smaller but
#   aligned gaps at 01:30.
#
#   Inside the frame there is a textured and lightly-colored disk,
#   whose outline is broken by nine features with frilled edges that
#   resemble fat mushrooms, or squashed cauliflowers, or sea anemones
#   without tentacles, or... um... well....
#
#   Between the text frame and the "mushroom thing" there are nine
#   radial phrases (unit "Y"), each with two or three words, reading
#   inwards, starting near the frame and ending in the notch between
#   two consecutive "mushrooms".
#
#   At the center of the diagram there us a star with six slender arms,
#   inscribed in a circle with many short and rounded fingers.
#   Between the star arms there are six labels (unit "X"), reading inwards.
#
#   A faint straight radial line extends from the 10:30 arm and
#   bisects the corresponding mushroom (which happens to be the
#   smallest one).
#
#   Just outside the many-fingered disk there is a ring of text
#   (unit "I"). Its starting point seems to be the radial line at 10:30.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The starting point of the outer ring is probably at the aligned gaps
#   at 01:30, although the person who scribbled on the copy seemed
#   to prefer the non-aligned gaps at 10:30.
#
#   The starting point of the outer labels may be at 01:30 too, since
#   that label has a "p" gallows. Another possibility is the label at
#   10:30, just counterclockwise of the smalest "mushroom" (and of its
#   bisecting line).
#
#   John Grove thinks that the labels were written counter-clockwise
#   as those that are upside down are the ones between 6:00-1:00.

#
#   This page spans the two outer recto panels of a six-panel fold-out.
#   The outermost one (f70r3) is only half as wide as a normal panel.
#
# Attributes:

#   Subject: astronomical

#
# Description:
#
#   The first panel (f70r2 proper) contains a circular diagram framed
#   by four rings of text (unit "C") between two faint mechanically
#   drawn circles. There are two faint radial strokes at 10:00, breaking the two
#   outer rings, and one at 09:05, breaking the two inner rings.
#
#   The second (half-)panel contains a paragraph with 13.7 lines of text
#   (unit "P"), part of which spans the fold between the two panels.
#
#   Inside the diagram's frame is an eight-pointed flower (or chubby
#   star), with serrated outline. A narrow channel or stem connects
#   the tip of each of the star arms to the frame.
#
#   Inside the flower there is a sun, containing a ring of text (unit
#   "I"), and inside it a human (woman's?) face with crossed eyes and
#   smooth light hair. The sun has eight S-shaped rays directed along
#   the star's arms, interleaved with eight long spikes with a bulbous
#   base, each touchng the diagram's frame.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Speculation is that the two inner circles are one paragraph since
#   they share the single line marker at 09:05, and the two outermost
#   are another paragraph since they share the double line marker at
#   10:00.
#
#   However those lines may be modern guesses.  The aligned gaps 
#   at 12:00 on the two outer rings and at 06:00 on the two inner rings
#   are equally plausible.

# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text (units "R1" through "R3", inner to
#   outer), each bounded by a pair of faint, mechanically drawn
#   circles.
#
#   Just outside the innermost ring of text there is a narrow band of
#   abstract decoration (Greek-like meanders, notched strips,
#   hatching, etc., and "notched square" motifs), delimited by another
#   mechanical circle.
#
#   One can see a small portion (the Northwest quarter, mostly) of
#   another mechanical circle, just inside the middle ring of text.
#   This arc of circle appears to bound, and even clip, the "nymph"
#   drawings inside it (see below).
#
#   In the centre of the diagram there are two fish, the top one
#   facing West, the bootom one facing East. Each fish has a long,
#   smooth, pointed snout (vaguely like a tapir's) and horizontal
#   mouth (the top fish is smiling, the other is sad). The body is
#   slender like a sturgeon's, with four rows of coarse scales. 
#   To the body are attached a triangular tail, pectoral and ventral fins
#   (presumably paired), and two short dorsal fins (one just behind
#   the head, one 2/3 of the way to the tailfin). The tailfin is lobed
#   and divided into "feathers", like a bird's tail.
#   
#   There is a seven-pointed star above the fish, with a Voynichese
#   label (unit "C"); and another one below, unlabeled. Between the
#   two fish there is a word in non-Voynich script, whose strokes
#   seem thicker and more angular than the Voynichese label above.
#
#   Two thin threads connect the fishes' mouths to the top star. The
#   threads merge just below the star, and connect to it between its
#   two lower rays. Both threads run clockwise; the lower one passing
#   below the fishes, thickens shortly after leaving the fish's mouth,
#   and at its lowest point it sends off a branch that connects to the
#   highest ray of the bottom star.
#
#   Between the inner and middle rings of text there is a broad band
#   containing 10 human figures or "nymphs", each coming out of a
#   horizontal cylinder. These cylinders look like sections of
#   drainage pipe, with flanges at both ends (cf. f78r). All
#   cylinders, except the one at 11:00, open counterclockwise, and the
#   nymphs face in the same direction. The nymphs have most of their
#   legs inserted horizontally into the "pipes", but bend quite
#   unnaturaly, bacwards or sideways, so that their torso is upright
#   (i.e. radial, with the head outwards).
#
#   Between the middle and the outer text rings are 19 (not 20)
#   nymphs. All are standing (radially, with the head outwards); all
#   are in frontal view, or slightly turned towards the clockwise
#   direction. Each of these nymphs is inside an upright barrel or
#   basket, reaching up to her waist (with only a couple of
#   exceptions). In proportion to the nymph, the barrel is about two
#   feet wide, and has a "lip" a couple of inches wide. All barrels
#   are decorated with various abstract patterns---stripes, hatchings,
#   circles, waves, etc.. The base of the barrel is hidden by the text
#   band. The four nymphs at the top, between 11:00 and 01:00 are
#   smaller and more cramped than the rest (and so are their barrels).
#
#   All figures are naked, and seem to be female: all have (or may
#   have) full breasts, and many have visible nipples. (But the inner
#   nymph at 09:00 seems to have nipples below her breasts.)
#
#   There is a star (or flower) next to each nymph, supported by a
#   wire-like tail---sometimes straight, sometimes S-shaped. All inner
#   nymphs except 10:00, 09:00, 08:00 are holding their stars by the
#   "tails". All other nymphs have their hands hidden inside the
#   barrels, and the star tails are coming out of the containers or
#   cylinders.
#
#   Each of the 29 figures is labeled with a ``word'' or phrase of
#   Voynich text (text units "S1" and "S2", inner and outer bands).
#   The spacing suggests the label is always placed at the right (i.e.
#   clockwise) of the corresponding nymph.
#
#   The following table summarizes the nymph attributes. The "spos"
#   column says whether the star is placed clockwise ("cw") or
#   counterclockwise ("ccw") of the nymph; for inner nymphs that is
#   also the direction where the tube is open. The "hold" column says
#   whether the nymph is holding the star (by a ray, or by the tail if
#   present). The "brst" column tells whether the nymph has visible
#   female breasts.

#
#   STYLE AND LAYOUT
#
#   Although the nypmhs are a bit awkwards and deformed, it looks as
#   if this drawing was done with more care than the other "Zodiac"
#   diagrams. (However, this impression may be due simply to better
#   preervation or reproduction.)
#
#   The fishes look quite realistic, except for the mouths. However
#   they may have been "invented" rather than copied from real models.
#
#   The barrels in the outer group are not well drawn; the sides are
#   neither parallel nor radial (i.e.vertical), especially in the one
#   at 10:45. The perspective is not quite correct ---the top is
#   tilted too much towards the viewer, and in four cases (05:30,
#   06:30, 10:15, 10:45) it is drawn as an eye, not an ellipse. The
#   decoration however curves around the barrel, as it should.
#
#   It seems that the artist planned to add another band of decoration
#   just inside the middle text ring. He/she lightly sketched the
#   inner bounding circle of that band, and carefully avoided it while
#   drawing the inner nymphs from 08:00 to 01:00. (By the way, this
#   explains why the nymph at 07:30 has her face crammed against the
#   fold.) But the nymphs from 01:00 to 08:00 overflowed that circle
#   (perhaps because it was too faint in those parts), and the band
#   was left undecorated.
#
#   From the kinks in the circles, and the appearance of figures and
#   text near the fold, its seems that the fold was already present
#   when the drawing was made.
#
#   THE FISH EMBLEM
#
#   The two fish are obviously the astrological symbol for Pisces,
#   which is February 20th to March 20th.
#
#   Rene Zandbergen [23 Feb 96] reports seeing an illustration of the
#   Pisces symbol [2] very similar to the center picture of f70v2, in
#   anatomy and proportions.
#
#   Rene [14 Mar 1997] notes that whenever there are two things in a
#   zodiac symbol (Cancer, Libra), or two copies of a diagram (Taurus,
#   Aries), one is light and the other is dark; but pisces is an
#   exception. (But "dark" and "light" may be just reproduction noise;
#   we should look at the original colors.)
#
#   THE "MONTH NAME"
#
#   The word between the fish could be "(m|n)((a|ci)(v|r)|w)(c|g)" in
#   Latin script, and is traditionally read "mars". Mars is French for
#   March. The first letter resembles the last letter of <f116v.P.1>
#   (the "michiton" line).
#
#   THE CENTRAL STARS
#
#   Don Latham [25 Apr 1997] notes that the star must be al-rischa
#   (the rope-knot) from his constellation atlas. [The label is
#   "otolal" in the best transcription.] Rene [5 Jan 1998] reports
#   howeer that "alrischa" is a late assignment.
#
#   Mark Sulla [26 Apr 1997] adds that 
#
#     Hipparchos and Ptolemy called it "sundesmos ton ikhthuon" or
#     "ton linon". Cicero et al called it "nodus", or "nodus
#     caelestis" and "nodus piscium" Pliny called it the "commissura
#     Piscium" The Almagest called it "nodus duorum filorum". The
#     asterism of the threads was variously called "vincla",
#     "alligamentum" "linteum" or "luteum". Hevelius subdivided it
#     into the "linum boream" and "austrinum". [1]
#
#   Rene [28 Apr 1997] observes however that the label need not be the
#   name, it could be some indication of its position: X deg Y min. He
#   also notes that alrischa belongs with the *constellation* of
#   Pisces, not the *sign*.
#
#   Rene [28 Apr 1997] suggests that Polaris would be a possible
#   candidate for the star, on account of its distinguished position
#   in the VMS. Don Latham [] objects, why should Polaris be in
#   Pisces?
#
#   Denis Mardle [28 Apr 97] notes that "otolal" does not seem to
#   occur in his files, but "otalal" does occur on <f58r.11;F>,
#   <f68v3.O.1;C>, <f70v2.R1.1;C>, <f71r.15A;K>, <f72v1.R3.1;C>,
#   <f107r.22;F>.
#
#   THE TEXT RINGS
#
#   According to Denis Mardle [14 Mar 97], the nymphs in tubes suggest
#   that the diagram should be read from the inside out.
#   (Unfortunately most text unit have been numbered the other way...)
#
#   Denis also observes [14 Mar 97] that a line through the two stars
#   in the center points 11:00, and goes through the only inner nymph
#   who is facing clockwise. Stolfi [here] thinks that the odd nymph
#   was reversed so as to face the 12:00 gap, and the 12:00 nymph
#   (with oustretched arm), because that is the "important" place in
#   that band.
#
#   THE NYMPHS
#  
#   Stolfi [11 Aug 1998] observes that f70v2 seems to go against the
#   general trend of the Zodiac section: as one goes from Aries to
#   Sagittarius, the nymphs get progressivley less clothed and more
#   exposed. So perhaps f70v2 was drawn after Aries.
#
#   Rene [14 Mar 1997] thinks that the nymphs coming out of tubes
#   strongly suggest birth (whether it be a person or the cosmos). On
#   the other hand, the disappearance of the barrels in subsequent
#   diagrams may be simply a result of the artist becoming more hasty.
#
#   Rene [14 Mar 1997] suggests also that the nymphs in tubes could
#   be linked with the alchemical concept of creation of a homunculus.
#
#   NYMPH/STAR COUNT
#
#   This folio is exceptional in having only 29 nymphs and stars. Rene
#   [8 May 1996] suggests that the star in the center may be the
#   missing 30th star. (But then why not count the other central star,
#   too?) He also mentions Pietro d'Abano, a 14th century occultist,
#   in whose astrological system each sign was divided into 30 "faces"
#   or parts.
#
#   Robert Firth [note 20] conjectures that the "29" was a mistake,
#   and the number should have been "30", like all other "months". 
#   But that is the Pharaonic Egyptian calendar; why would anyone
#   revive it?  
#
#   Stolfi [here] thinks the artist had planned to draw 20 nymphs in the 
#   outer band, by drawing 4 small ones at the top, then 4 more in each of 
#   the four quadrants.  This he did in the first three quadrants, going
#   clockwise; but then he got confused (perhaps by the fold), and drew only 
#   3 nymphs in the last quadrant, from 09:00 to 12:00.
#
#   THE STAR LABELS
#   
#   Denis Mardle [27 Mar 97] notes that 16 of the star labels start
#   with EVA "ok", 8 start with "ot", 2 start with "yt" --- and yet all
#   are different.  
#
#   Denis also notes that S1.13 and S1.14 both occur on Libra, f72v1.
#   Robert Firth [note 07] observes similarities between the nymph
#   labels on f72v2 and those in the Biological page f82v.
#
#   WHY PISCES?
#
#   Guy Thibault [4 Mar 1996] finds it strange that the VMS zodiac
#   begins with Pisces, instead of Aries as is usual in astrology.
#   Robert Firth [note 20] observes that the Egyptian year began in
#   our July, with the heliacal rising of Sirius.
#
#   Dan Moonhawk Alford [4 Mar 1996] and Adams Douglas [29 Apr 1997]
#   note that Pisces is actually astronomically correct (and has been
#   for many centuries). But Robert asks --- why, alone of all works
#   of Western astrology, is the Voynich Zodiac true to the stars?
#
#   Rayman Maleki [08 Sep 1997] says that a 15th century rebirth of
#   astrology and medicine gave Pisces astrological control over the
#   body. Pictures from this time often have a person standing firmly
#   on the fish. He mentions a drawing of an apothecary shop in Prague
#   that had two fish as symbol on the sign. 
#
#   Rayman [08 Sep 1997] suggests that, alternatively, Pisces may be
#   the beginning of the planting year. Or the VMS may be a reading
#   for someone born in Pisces. Rene [17 Jul 1998] proposes as a
#   possible VMs author a certain George of Trebizond, who "had a firm
#   belief in astrology and wrote that his fated life was controlled
#   by his birth in the sign of Pisces." Moreover, he was once jailed
#   because of his `libido'.
#
#   Glen Claston [25 Feb 1998] says that he saw EVA "&169" used as a
#   power seal symbol related to Pisces, in a book on Honorius in an
#   occult shop, but the book gave no reference to its origin.
#   (Honorius was 13th? century but all related symbols in the
#   paperback were 14th century.)
#
#   Rene [21 Apr 1997] and Denis [24 Apr 97] mention a set of
#   conjuntions of Saturn and Jupiter in 1464, 1524 and 1583 in
#   Pisces; the 1524 was believed to announce a terrible deluge
#   because of the watery sign.
#
#   ZODIAC, OR SOMETHING ELSE?
#
#   Guy Thibault [4 Mar 1996] suggests that the signs could stand for
#   years in the life of an individual, and each nymph for a month;
#   and that the "kings' and "queens" could be real historical people.
#   The 9 nymphs in tubes of this picture could be the 9 months in the
#   womb. Robert Firth [note 07] proposes a similar idea - that the
#   "zodiac" is a list of "lucky" and "unlucky" days.
#
#   Rene [8 Mar 1996] takes up Guy's suggestion and estimates that the
#   individual shoudl have been 25-30 years old at the time of
#   writing, or died at that age. But there are 10, not 9 nymphs in
#   horizontal tubes, so this period is more likely post-natal than
#   pre-natal. As for kings and queens, he mentions that Agrippa's
#   sister became queen of Navarre...

#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram defined by three narrow concentric bands, each
#   delimited by two faint, mechanically drawn circles.
#
#   The innermost band is quite narrow, and empty. The middle and
#   outer bands contain each a ring of text, reading clockwise. The
#   text in the middle band (unit "R1") has a slightly wider word gap
#   at 06:00, and is interrupted at 08:30 by a black irregular spot.
#   (The same spot appears on the facing page f71r, quod videt.) The
#   text in the outer band (unit "R2") has a noticeably wider word gap
#   at 03:45. Both rings are penetrated at 10:30 by "stars"---see
#   below).
#
#   Inside the innermost band is a four-legged, hoofed animal
#   resembling a beardless goat. The animal has short fur
#   (dark-colored), sharp horns that curve packwards, and a short and
#   chubby tail. It also seems to have a crest of short hairs running
#   along the spine, from head to tip of tail.
#
#   The animal is nibbling at a bush, standing on a scalloped (rocky?)
#   ground. Below the animal's belly is a non-Voynichese word.
#
#   In the broad space between the ouer and middle bands there are 10
#   human figures, or "nymphs"; and 5 more in the space between the
#   middle and inner bands---or 15 nymphs in total. Each nymph is
#   standing (radially, with the head outwards) in frontal view, or
#   slightly turned towards the corresponding "star" (see below). All
#   nymphs look female; most have prominent breasts, and the two
#   exceptions (in frontal view) are rather poorly drawn, so the lack
#   of breasts is not conclusive.
#
#   Some of the nymphs are dressed, but the nipples and body outline
#   often show threough the dress. Most nymphs, even naked ones, wear
#   some kind of headgear (hat, veil, diadem, etc.)
#
#   Every nymph is standing inside an upright cylindrical container or
#   "barrel". In proportion to the nymph, the barrel is about two feet
#   wide, and has a "lip" a couple of inches wide. It usually reaches
#   up to the nymph's pelvis---sometimes bit lower, sometimes up to
#   her chest. Most of the barrels are decorated with distinctive
#   patterns of bars, dots, hatchings, circles, scales, etc.; but two
#   barrels have only a ring of dots, near the top edge, and three are
#   undecorated. The base of the barrel is hidden by the text band.
#
#   Each nymph has a star or flower by her head; usually on the
#   clockwise side, with four exceptions (inner 00:00, 02:30, 05:00,
#   and outer 03:30). Some stars have wire-like tails or stems. The
#   star at 10:30 in the inner band has a thicker, distinctive tail,
#   like a banded snake. Moreover, the two stars at 10:30 (inner and
#   outer) intrude slightly into the surrounding text ring.
#
#   Some nymphs are holding their stars (by a ray or by the tail);
#   others are pointing at them; and some have both hands on the hips,
#   usually hidden by the barrel.
#
#   Between every two nymphs there is a one- or two-word label (units
#   "S1" and "S2"), reading clockwise. From the spacing, it would seem
#   that every label refers to the preceding nymph, going clockwise.
#
#   The following table summarizes the nymph and star attributes. The
#   "spos" column gives the position of the star relative to the
#   nymph: "cw" if clockwise, "ccw" if counterclockwise. The "deco"
#   column tells whether the barrel has "full" decoration, or just a
#   ring of "dots", or "no" decoration at all. The "dres" and "brst"
#   columns say whether the nymph is dressed and has visible female
#   breasts, respectively. The "hold" column says whether the nymph is
#   holding the star (by a ray, or by the tail if present).

#    
#   There is a mark "10^{mg}" at the lower right corner of the page. 
#   It is certainly a gathering mark (quire number), "10th" in
#   abbreviated Latin.
#
# Comments:
#
#   STYLE AND LAYOUT
#
#   The ram/goat is drawn very skillfully and looks quite realistic,
#   except that the way its front legs bend looks wrong. (But I am 
#   a city boy, what do I know...)
#
#   The barrels are drawn rather poorly: better than those of f71r
#   (Aries light) but worse than those of f70v2 (Pisces). The width
#   and height are quite variable. The perspective is minimally
#   correct, but the top of the barrel is tilted at varying angles
#   relative to the observer, from near edge-on (outer 08:00) to
#   almost face-on (inner 02:30). In three cases (outer 02:45 and
#   03:45, inner 08:00) the top is rendered as an eye, not an ellipse.
#   
#   The pattern on the inner barrel at 00:00 is rather peculiar.
#   Unlike the other patterns it is neither symmetric nor repeating;
#   it looks rather like a cubist painting. It looks as if the barrel
#   is made of glass, so that the nymph's legs and hands are showing
#   through. (Perhaps the pattern was drawn to hide a mistake, or 
#   an artistic failure?)
#
#   THE CENTRAL EMBLEM
#
#   The central figure is widely believed to be a symbol of the sign
#   Aries. The word below the animal could be "ab**il" in the Latin
#   alphabet. It is traditionally read as some variant of the month
#   name "April". Aries goes from ??? to ???.
# 
#   THE TEXT RINGS
#
#   There is no obvious starting place for the text rings. The wider
#   breaks at 04:00 (outer) and 06:00 (inner) are not aligned, and do
#   not seem to be natural choices for starting the text. The binding
#   gutter at 03:00 is not it either, as the text was visibly squeezed
#   to fit in that part of the ring. 
#
#   The most likely starting places, IMHO, are the places at 10:45
#   where the stars intrude into the text bands. Note that the inner
#   star has the special striped "tail", and the outer star is being
#   held high up by the nymph. (However, the first star enters just
#   before a "daiin", and the second one under a word; so there is
#   reason to doubt.)
#
#   THE NYMPHS
#
#   Either the dresses are meant to be transparent, or they were added
#   later, in an attempt to mask the naked bodies.
#
#   THE LABELS
#
#   The outer label at 08:30 (<f70v1.S1.9;U>) reads "otshshdy" in standard EVA.
#   The two "sh" have quite different plumes---the first one is a closed
#   drop-like loop, the second is a open hook.

# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram defined by six faint mechanically drawn
#   concentric circles, forming three narrow bands. The two outer bands
#   each contain a ring of text, broken by a decorated section in each
#   band, at 10:00.
#
#   In the center there is an animal resembling a beardless goat,
#   light-colored, nibbling at a bush, standing on a scalloped (rocky ?)
#   ground. below it is a non-voynich word "ab*i*l".
#
#   In the space between the inner and middle bands there are 5
#   nymphs, and 10 more in the space between the middle and outer band.
#   Each nymph is standing inside an upright barrel, with a star or
#   flower next to her head. Some stars have tails (or stems); some nymphs
#   are holding their stars, by a ray or by the tail, others are
#   pointing at them, some have their both hands on the hips. All but one of
#   the nymphs are heavily dressed, and none have salient breasts or visible
#   nipples.
#
#   There is a label clockwise from each nymph.
#
# Comments
#
#   Presumably, the "notched square" devices at 10:30 may be the "start
#   here" mark of the circular text bands.
#
#   The goat is drawn better than the dark Aries (f70v1), and its legs
#   bend the right way, unlike those of the light Aries (f71r). The
#   nymphs (and the barrels), on the other and, are even worse than

#   Panels: f71v
#   Bifolio: bK1 = f71+f72

#
#   Roe, 8th September 1993
#   Machine translated from a transcription in Bennett notation of 26/04/90
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: Z (Rene), zod (Stolfi)
#   Subject: zodiac
#   Colors: red(lots),green(some) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. A wider gap in the outer ring at 10:30 may be the 
#   starting place.
#
#   In the centre is a horned animal feeding from a manger. Below the
#   bull is the word ``May'' in the Roman alphabet.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are five human
#   figures or "nymphs", each standing in a barrel, waist deep,
#   holding a star. One is naked, four are clothed. The barrel at
#   00:00 is ribbed.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring are 10 human figures,
#   each in a barrel, waist deep, holding a star. Two are naked, eight
#   are clothed.
#
#   Most figures have visible breasts. Some have hats. All figures have
#   their right hand inside the barrel.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a bull, the astrological
#   symbol for Taurus. Taurus is April 20th to May 20th.
#
#   The general appearance of the page is light, in contrast to the
#   dark Taurus, f72r1.

#   This page is the innermost recto panel of an eight-panel fold-out.

#   Colors: dark-red,green(little),yellow(stars) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. There is no obvious starting place.
#
#   In the centre is a horned animal feeding from a manger. Below the
#   bull is the word ``May'' in the Roman alphabet.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are 6 human
#   figures or "nymphs", each holding a star. Five are standing in a
#   barrel, waist deep; a sixth one is peeking from behind the barrel
#   at 08:30. All have the right hand inside the barrel, except for
#   the small one at 08:30 (right hand behind barrel) and the one at
#   02:00 (right hand resting on the barrel's edge). The figure inside
#   the 08:30 barrel is holding a smaller star, lower and closer to
#   her than the other figures.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring are 10 human figures,
#   standing.  The one at 00:00 is in frontal view, all others are 
#   in 3/4 view, between frontal and facing clockwise.  The one at 
#   02:30 has the right arm straight back and down; all the others
#   have the right hand on their hips.
#
#   All the figures are naked. Most have visible breasts. Some have
#   hats, some have long hair.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The general appearance of the page is dark, in contrast to the
#   light Taurus, f71v.
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a bull, the astrological
#   symbol for Taurus. Taurus is April 20th to May 20th.
#
#   [Stolfi] I count 16 nymphs in this page, but other people give the
#   total as 15. Presumably they are not counting the smaller nymph
#   without barrel.
#
#   It looks as if the artist decided to add one more figure at the
#   last minute, and had to improvise...

# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. A short radial stroke at 10:30 in the inner ring may be the 
#   starting place.
#
#   In the centre there are two human figures, apparently a man and a woman,
#   holding each other hands---left in left, below, and right in right, above.
#   The man wears a wide hat, a shirt with long narrow sleeves,
#   ring collar, simple belt, a skirt with trimmed edge reaching below the knee, 
#   and boots.  The woman wears an elaborate draped dress, with ring collar,
#   broad sleeves with wrist bands, a small bonnet with long hair or a veil 
#   hanging down her back, and a skirt that drags on the floor.  Between
#   the two figures is a word in the latin alphabet (``Jony'' according to 
#   Robert Firth.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are 9 naked
#   human figures or "nymphs", all female, each standing with the
#   right hand on her hip, holding a star with her left.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring there are 16 nymphs,
#   standing, each holding a star with the left hand. Four are clothed,
#   the rest is naked. Most are definitely women (with visible breasts);
#   the rest are probably women, or could be. Three of the figures two
#   of them clothed) are standing on top of horizontal cylinders,
#   resembling the ones on f70v2. Usualy the right hand is resting on
#   the hip, but in a couple of cases the right arm is drooping by the
#   victim's side, or straight down and back, and one figure (at 04:00)
#   has the arms streched out horizontally.
#
#   Standing on top of the diagram, outside the text circle, are another 5
#   naked women, right hand on the hip, each holding a star.
#
#   All figures are drawn in 3/4 view, between frontal and clockwise-facing.
#   Some of the figures are walking. Some of the figures have hats.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The sign of Gemini, the Twins, has sometimes been represented by a 
#   man and woman. Gemini is ??? to ???.

# Description:
#
#   (Beware that the scanned image is upside down.)
#
#   Four concentric rings of text (units "C1" through "C4", from
#   outside in), bounded by eight faint mechanically drawn circles,
#   roughly centered on the page. Circles 5 and 6 (from the outside)
#   are spaced apart almost twice as much as the other pairs. The
#   outermost text ring runs over the crease on the left side of the
#   panel, and into the diagram of f72r2; for that reason the text is
#   interrupted between 08:00 and 10:00. The middle ring of text has a
#   decorated "notched square" at 09:00, and the innermost text ring
#   has a wider word break at 08:55.
#
#   In the centre there is a pair of lobster-like creatures seen from
#   above. The one at the top is light-colored and facing East, the
#   bottom one is dark and facing West. Below them is a non-Voynichese
#   word, in a heavier hand than the other text in the page.
#
#   The rings of text delimit three circular bands, containing (from
#   outside in) respectively 12, 11, and 7 human figures or "nymphs",
#   i.e. 30 in total. There is a label just clockwise of each figure
#   (text units "Z", "Y", "X", from outside in).
#
#   Some figures are hardly visible due to the poor copy quality. All
#   figures seem to be naked, except for occasional headgear (hat,
#   bonnet, diadem, and one crown). They are standing (radially, with
#   the head outwards), in 3/4 view (between frontal and facing
#   clockwise). Some have visible breasts, some don't. Most are
#   holding a star with the right hand; the left hand is generally on
#   the hip. Some stars have "tails".
#
#   The following table summarizes the nymph and star attributes. Here
#   "cw" means clockwise, "ccw" counterclockwise. The "brst" column
#   says whether the figure has visible female breasts.

# Comments:
#
#   The two lobsters are probably a symbol for Cancer.
#   Cancer is July 7 to August 11 (?).
#
#   Note the switch from two bands of nymphs + overflow (as in f72r2)
#   to three bands of figures.
#
#   The decorated square suggests the text rings are to be read 
#   starting at 09:00 or so.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "Leo"
#   Page: f72v3 = KF (Rene) = p140 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f72
#   Panels: f72v4, f72v3
#   Bifolio: bK1 = f71+f72
#   Quire: K (Rene) = XI (Beinecke)
#
#   This page spans the two outermost verso panels of an eight-panel
#   fold-out. (The outermost panel is about 1/3 the width of a normal
#   one.)
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: Z (Rene), zod (Stolfi)
#   Subject: zodiac
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, deimited by six faint mechanically
#   drawn circles. The outer and inner rings have wider word gaps 
#   at 08:45. (The middle ring crosses a fold at that point).
#
#   In the centre is an animal resembling a lioness, facing west. The
#   animal has a very short and sparse mane, and a long tail ending in
#   a tuft of hair. The tail curved down, between or behind the rear
#   legs, then up behind body, and then forward. The right front paw
#   is lifted and points West. The animal has a muzzle similar to that
#   of the nibbling animal in f???, and is showing a longish, narrow,
#   pointed tongue.
#
#   Below the lion is a non-Voynichese word, possibly "augst" in
#   lowercase Latin letters. There may be a dot over the first leg of
#   the "u". The "s" looks like an uncrossed "f" with a straight
#   descender. The "t" looks like an EVA "c".
#
#   The three rings of text define two bands containing human figures
#   (12 in the inner band, 18 in the outer one), all naked, in 3/4
#   view (between frontal and facing clockwise). Each figure holds a
#   star with the left hand. The right hand is generally on the hip.
#
#   All the figures are naked. Most have visible breasts and 
#   shoulder-long hair.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a lion, the astrological
#   symbol for Leo. Leo is ??? to ???.

#   Title: "Virgo"

#   Folio: f72
#   Panels: f72v2
#   Bifolio: bK1 = f71+f72
#   Quire: K (Rene) = XI (Beinecke)
#
#   This page is the central verso panel of n eight-panel fold-out.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: Z (Rene), zod (Stolfi)
#   Subject: zodiac
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. The outer ring crosses the fold into page
#   f72v3, and runs under that page's diagram, so the text is
#   interrupted between 08:30 and 09:30. There are notable gaps on the
#   other two rings at about 09:30.
#
#   The two outermost circles are not exactly concentric, and the 
#   third one doesn't quite close on itself (at 06:30).
#
#   Inside the inner circle there is a woman (with breasts) standing,
#   wearing a long pleated dress with flaring sleeves, and a hat or
#   hat-like hairdo.  With her right hand she is holding a star, by its tail; 
#   the left hand is empty and half-stretched forward. At her feet there
#   is a tuft of grass and a daisy-like flower. Above the flower
#   is a word in a dark, different script (possibly "septe~br" with the 
#   tilde over the "e").
#
#   Between the bands of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 12 in the inner one, 18 in the outer one. Most of them
#   are clearly female, but some have undefined sex (no breasts but also
#   no genitals).  The inner ring figure at 04:00 is smaller and is
#   standing on a tub or platform of some sort.
#
#   Each nymph is holding or pointing to a star, some by its tail ---
#   except for the inner nymph at 00:30, who is just looking at the
#   star, and the inner nymph at 01:30, who has no star. There is 
#   a label under each star.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The gaps at 09:30 suggest the text should be read starting from there.
#
#   The way f72v3 overlaps f72v2 indicates that they were drawn in
#   that order.
#
#   Rene [27 Mar 1996] observes similarities between the zodiac
#   symbols in the VMs and those in a 1440 german manuscript [1]. Says
#   in particular that Virgo in that manuscript holds a flower and not
#   a star.
#
#   Adams Douglas [28 Mar 1996] thinks the star held by the
#   symbol-woman is Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, usually on the
#   her head or a sceptre.

# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. The outer ring runs right up to the binding
#   gutter on the right. There may be a wider word gap at 09:00 (but
#   the image is very poor there). A radial stroke cuts across the
#   middle ring at 08:30 (may be a modern scribble).
#
#   The two circles that delimit the inner ring of text are quite 
#   irregular.
#
#   Inside the inner ring there is a two-plate balance scale,
#   slightly offset to the right. The beam is a narrow rectangular
#   ruler, with a darker stripe running down its middle. The pivot is
#   not visible, but seems to be fixed at the bottom of an upright
#   rectangular frame, with a handle or ring on top (partly hidden
#   under the innermost text ring). A narrow triangular pointer rises
#   from the beam's midpoint up to the top of the supporting frame. An
#   object resembling a sliding counterweight seems to be resting over
#   the beam, a little to the left of the pivot. Each end of the beam
#   has a thin horizontal extension, from whose tip there hangs a
#   hemispherical cup with thick walls, supported by three or four
#   straight threads or wires.
#
#   Below the scale there is a single word in non-Voynich script,
#   apparently "oct~ebre" in lowercase Latin cursive (with a
#   tilde or macron over the "te").
#
#   Between the bands of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 10 in the inner one, 20 in the outer one. Most of them
#   are clearly female (visible breasts, long hair).  All nymphs are naked,
#   mostly in 3/4 view (between frontal and facing clockwise).
#
#   A hole in the vellum, less than 5mm across, covers a small segment
#   of the middle ring. at 03:00. The preceding word runs up to the
#   hole, but is apparently whole. A nymph in the inner band, at
#   03:15, also has the hair squeezed against the hole.
#
#   The outer nymph at 12:15 wears a crown, consisting of a ring of
#   flaring triangular points, each with a dot; and a dome with double
#   outline, topped by a spike or cross (too small to tell).
#
#   Each nymph is holding or pointing to a star.
#
#   There is a Voynichese label just clockwise of each nymph.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The scale is the standard symbol for the sign of Libra.
#   Libra is from ??? to ???.
#
#   The stroke at 08:30, if original, suggests that the text should be
#   read starting from there.
#
#   The way f72v3 overlaps f72v2 indicates that they were drawn in
#   that order.
#
#   The drawing of the balance is very accurate in all details, in
#   spite of the relatively crude perspective and technique. It looks
#   as if the author was very familiar with the instrument. I suspect
#   that the model may be more appropriate for a druggist than for a
#   grocer.
#
#   The details of the drawings around the hole suggest that the
#   hole was already there when the drawing was made.

#
#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. There seem to be no distinguished break
#   in the text.
#
#   Inside the inner circle is a squat animal. A dark smudge
#   obliterates most of the animal's body, leaving visible only the
#   head (roundish, with a wide mouth and two very short and broad
#   horns) and the tail (that curves up, forward, down, then up
#   again). Above the animal is a seven-pointed star with a tail that
#   ends in the animal's mouth. 
#
#   Below the animal is an illegible word.
#
#   Between the rings of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 10 in the inner one and 16 in the outer one. Four
#   additional nymphs are standing on top of the outer ring of text.
#   Most of them are female (with breasts and shoulder-long hair).
#
#   Each nymph is holding or pointing to a star.
#
#   There is a label just clockwise of each nymph.

#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. At 09:30 there is a wider gap in the middle
#   ring and a radial stroke (a modern scribble on the copy?) cutting
#   across the outer ring.
#
#   Inside the inner circle is a beardless human figure, apparently
#   smiling, walking Westward. The figure (possibly, but not
#   necessarily male) is wearing a hat with round rim and a long veil
#   or plume falling down the back, to the waist. He also wears a
#   shirt with ring collar and broad sleeves, closed at the wrist; a
#   flaring skirt, with heavy pleats, down to knee level; and boots to
#   mid-leg.
#
#   The figure is holding an armed crossbow, pointing forward and down.
#
#   Between the figure's feet is an almost illegible word, possibly
#   "oct" in lowercase Latin alphabet (with a "t" resembling EVA "c")
#
#   Between the rings of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 10 in the inner one and 16 in the outer one. There

# Labels on nymphs in the top pond
# The picture suggests a water stream splashing on an elongated

# From the pond, ten ruvulets fall on ten naked nymphs,
# who are standing ankle-deep in an elongated tub. 
# There are two lines of text just above the nymphs, broken into
# ten words by the rivulets ("-" below).
#
# They have been transcribed below as ten pairs of words,

# The picture resembles a lower pond sunk into the ground,
# fed by a tube from the tub further up the page.
# The pond is packed with 19 naked nymphs, ankle-deep in the water.
#
# There is a normal-looking paragraph on the right side of the pond.
# On the left side there are about 6 words at the top, apparently
# not aligned with the text, and presumed to be labels (below).
# There are also 6 short lines of text; these were assumed to be

#
# Description:
#  
#   The page contains two blocks of text, surrounded and separated by 
#   three figures.
#
#   The upper block of text contains a single paragraph (text unit
#   "P1") with 8.8 lines, justified top and left; its right side is
#   defined by an illustration. Another part of the same illustration
#   also interrupts the first 5 lines down the middle. The lower block
#   contains two paragraphs with 8.0 and 13.5 lines, separated by a
#   right-justified half-line of text (a "title"). The block is
#   justified on the left, its right boundary is irregular and partly
#   defined by the figure.
#
#   The top figure consists of two nymphs, near the NW and NE of the
#   page; a "vessel" in the middle; and tubes connecting these three
#   elements across the top margin of the page. The NW nymph has a
#   diadem and is standing inside "cup", which is decorated with rings
#   of dots, knobs, and hoops, and tapers down to nothing. The nymph
#   has her hand inside an arched tube that ends in the "central
#   vessel", shose shape is similar to the nymph's "cup". The NE nymph
#   is standing inside a large, smooth tube, that bends to the rigth
#   and exits the page. It too has her hand inside an arched tube that
#   ends in the "central vessel".

#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram. The outer frame consists
#   of a ring of text between two faint mechanically-drawn circles. The
#   starting point of the text is not evident. ( The whole arc between
#   08:00 and 10:00 is unreadable in the source image. There is also an
#   extra-wide gap at 07:30, but it may be just a faded word.)
#
#   At the center of the diagram is a sun with neutral expression
#   and narrow reverse-S-shaped rays. Surrounding it is a colored disk
#   textured with a whirlpool pattern, bent clockwise-out. 
#
#   The disk is framed by a circular band with six semicircular lobes
#   (one each at North and South, two each at West and East), containing
#   a ring of text and delimited by two narrow, decorated, cordon-like
#   borders. A double radial stroke, cutting across the frame at 09:00,
#   seems to mark the starting point of the text. The inner border of
#   the frame consists of two mechanically drawn circles, about a
#   millimeter apart, and is decorated by 10 pairs of double parentheses
#   ((   )). The outer border is a hand drawn solid double line with a
#   line of dots down the middle.
#
#   The space between the inner and outer frames is divided into unequal
#   sectors by four beams, placed like the arms of an "X". The beams are
#   narrower near the center than at the periphery. Each beam continues
#   past and under the outer frame, ending in a broad plume, resembling
#   a soft wet brush. The plume makes a sharp U-turn and passes again
#   behind the outer frame, while tapering down to a point. The NE plume
#   bends clockwise, the other three bend counterclockwise.
#
#   Each sector between the outer and inner frames contains a paragraph
#   of text near the outer end (to be read clockwise), and a human
#   figure. The sex of the figures is indeterminate, as neither breasts
#   nor beards are visible. The South figure is leaning on a staff, and
#   looks like an old man or woman; the other three could be women or
#   young men, possibly children.
#
#   The figures are partially hidden behind by the inner frame: the
#   South figure is hidden from the knees down by the inner frame, and
#   the other three are hidden from the waist down. All four figures
#   wear a colored, buttonless shirt, with long and narrow sleeves,
#   which in the South figure is seen to be a tunic or dress, ending
#   just above the knee. Ring collars are visible in the North and West
#   figures. All three figures have light hair, bushy over the ears and
#   cropped just below them. The East figure wears a dark
#   skullcap.
#
#   The right hands of West, North, and East are hidden by the inner
#   frame. With the left hand, North seems to be pointing to the last
#   word of the text above (which sits on a line by itself); East holds
#   an unidentified dark object, consisting of two stacked bulbs of unequal
#   size, topped by a short spike (it could be a root); and West seems
#   to be holding a flower, shaped like a lily but dark colored. South
#   holds a staff with the left hand, and a chain with three huge rings
#   on his right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It has been conjectured that the four figures represent the Four
#   Ages of Man. If the diagram is to be read clockwise, like the text,
#   then West (who lies over the "start marker", by the way) would be
#   Infancy. However, East (with the skullcap) looks younger than the
#   other three.

#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, and under it a single paragraph 
#   of text (5 lines, the last one short and centered).
#
#   The diagram is framed by two faint mechanically dawn circles, and
#   four rings of text --- one betweent the two circles, the other three
#   just inside the second circle. A wide gap in all four rings at 09:00
#   suggests an obviosu starting point, confirmed by four radial strokes
#   across the first ring (that may be modern scribbles in the copy,
#   however). 
#
#   (There are other simultaneous gaps in all four rings at 01:00 and
#   05:00, so the four rings may actually be two or three paragraphs
#   side by side.)
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is an uncolored disk, bounded by
#   a mechanically drawn circle, containing a small moon---with a dark
#   crescent shadow on the left side, and a human face with neutral
#   expression on the right.
#
#   Just outside this central disk there is a wide decorated band
#   containing four small human figures. The decoration looks like a
#   perspective drawing of a flat field, bent around the inner disk with
#   the innermost edge being closer to the observer. In the "field"
#   there are five parallel rows (concentric rings) of elements, shaped
#   like tombstones with rounded top. The "tombstones" are painted in
#   various colors, and some have dots, borders, or other simple
#   decoration. In the innermost ring, which is unobstructed, the
#   elements are fused together at the base.
#
#   Between these rows of "tombstones", the field is packed with round
#   objects (which could be bushes, leaves, pebbles, bubbles, etc.).
#
#   The "tombstones" in the first four rows are packed tight, and a
#   larger "tombstone" is inserted every 3-6 standard ones. The last row
#   (outermost ring) has only small tombstones, painted with alternating
#   colors, some distance apart (with some blades of "grass" in
#   between). 
#
#   The third row of tombstones is interrupted at 11:30, 02:30, 05:30,
#   and 08:30 by four human figures. The human figures are hidden by the
#   "bushes" from the waist down. The North figure is barely visible,
#   because of a a crease in the vellum. The West and South figures are
#   female (with visible breasts), and the same may be true of the other
#   two. They wear a white dress with ring collar and broad sleeves,
#   apparently tied at the wrists. Their hair is dark but not black, and
#   is just long enough to cover the ears. The South, West, and North
#   figures have both arms spread out like a "W", with hands open; East
#   has only the left arm up, in the same position.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "nine-rosette diagram"
#   Page: f85v2 = NC+ND+NE+NF+NG+NH (Rene) = p169 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f85+f86
#   Panels: f85v2+f86r4+f86r6+f85v1+f86r3+f86r5
#   Bifolio: bN1 = f85+f86
#   Quire: N (Rene) = XIV (Beinecke)
#
#   This is the top left panel(?) of the main face of a 12-panel foldout.
#
#   Panels 85v2, 86r4, 86r6 (top), and 85v1, 86r3, 86r5 (bottom)
#   comprise a single logical page, here called f85v2, which is the
#   main face of a 12-panel fold-out. This is the only face that can
#   be entirely seen when all folds are opened. All the panels
#   obviously belong to the same bifolio, which is bound at the
#   vertical fold between panels 85v1 and 86r3.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: B (Currier)

#
# Description:
#
#   This face of the fold-out contains an elaborate diagram consisting
#   of nine main circular diagrams or "rosettes" connected by things
#   that resemble roads, rivers, tubes, etc. Using compass directions
#   as labels for the rosettes, the general layout is roughly like this:
#   
#      *
#     = NW----N----NE
#     = | \   |   / |
#       |     |     |
#       W--- Ctr----E
#       |  *  |     |
#       | /   |   \ |
#       SW----S----SE
#      o
#
#   (The right 1/3 of this design is incomplete and based on verbal
#   descriptions by others; I have not seen panels f86r5 and
#   f86r6 yet.)
#
#   The top and bottom rosettes lie one in each of the six panels,
#   roughly centered. The rosettes in the middle row sit on top of the
#   horizontal fold. The center rosette is the largest one
#   while the mid-side ones (N, E, S, W) are the smallest.
#
#   There is a ring of text around each rosette, and dozens of labels
#   all over the place. Unfortunately the copy on which this
#   description is based is almost illegible and is lacking the entire
#   East column of the diagram (panels f86r6 and f86r5).
#
#   Several object in this diagram seem to be covered by tongue-like
#   "scales" or sprouts (see glossary).  In several places these scales
#   pile up into a small conical mound or "fountain", which seems to emit
#   a small "jet" (which looks like a tuff of stiff hair).
#
#   The NW rosette (panel f85v2):
#
#     This rosette is surrounded by by two thin mechanically drawn
#     circles that bound a ring of text, with a wide gap at 09:30.
#     Inside this ring is a band of scales turned inwards, giving the
#     impression of a hollow spherical shell with closely-packed
#     finger-like buds sprouting from the inside surface. The band of
#     scales is fringed with a band of hairs, also pointing inwards,
#     and a circle of small dots.
#
#     At the center of this "shell" is a round (slightly oblong)
#     object, also decorated with scales, hairs, and tiny dots
#     but pointing outwards. The object seems to have a opening shaped
#     like an eye on its side, as if a slice had been cut from a
#     melon. The interior of the object seems to be hollow. The edges
#     of the hole are fringed with many small "teeth" or "flames",
#     sharp and curved, directed inwards. On the right edge of the
#     cut, on the boundary between the scales and the flames, there is
#     a single word.
#
#     North, East, and South of the NW rosette there is a complex of
#     scalloped and hatched areas that suggests a very rough surface.
#     Cutting through this hatching, and apparently higher than it, are
#     some flat areas that resemble broad wawering roads. One "road"
#     connects the rosette to a wide flat "plateau" North of it, that
#     extends beyond the panel's edge. Another road goes East to the 
#     N rosette (panel f86r4) and a third road goes South to the  
#     W rosete (split between panels f85v1 and f85v2).  
#
#     The East-going (NW to N) road narrows quickly, and is
#     interrupted halfway by a round court. (Actually the court is
#     foreshortened to an oval; this part of the diagram is drawn as
#     seen from due West, high above the road.) Two narrow
#     paths---slightly convex, with parapets---connect this plaza to
#     the N rosette. The trapezoidal space between the two paths could
#     be a hole or a flowerbed. The road and plaza are edged by an
#     artificial-looking wall, interrupted by a few square columns or
#     towers of the same height. In the middle of the road there is a
#     round multistory tower, with a sharp conical roof.
#     
#     The South-going (NW to W) road sports five labels: one at each
#     end, one in the middle, and one on each side, outside the road.
#     It is apparently drawn as seen obliquely from the South.
#     
#     Five straight tubes exit from the NW rosette's outline, directed
#     Southeast towards the center rosette. They seem supported at
#     their base by a rampart with multiple scalloped outline. The
#     tubes are arranged symmetrically, with one in center and four,
#     slightly narrower, around it. They stop in mid-air with flat
#     open ends, as if all were cut with a single stroke. There is a
#     label further ahead of the tubes and aligned with their axis.
#
#     Further nortwest of this rosette, right next to the panel's
#     corner, there is a small sun with long sinuous rays. West of the
#     rosette, squeezed against the left edge of the panel, is a
#     narrow text with two paragraphs of 4.0 (or 5.0?) and 4.0 lines.
#
#   The NE rosette (panel f86r6)
#
#     This panel is missing in my copy. However one can see part of
#     the road connecting the NE rosette to the N rosette. What can be
#     seen is almost a mirror image of the road from NE to N: a
#     broadening road, edged by artifical walls with square posts or
#     towers. However there is no flower bed dividing the road in two,
#     as there is on the other side. The plaza and fountain, if any,
#     lie in panel <f86r6>.
#
#   The SW rosette (panel f85v1)
#
#     The SW rosette is bounded by a ring of text (unit "C1") bordered two
#     faint mechanically drawn circles.  There are gaps in the text at 
#     01:30 and 07:30.
#     
#     Inside the text ring is a "plateau" with scalloped boundary,
#     with 8 extensions or "passages" leaving in different directions.
#     Each passage has a peculiar outline, sort of a pair of trumpets
#     joined at their narrow ends by a "bulb-like" swelling. The passages
#     are flat like the plateau but are surrounded by a several wavy
#     lines, sugegsting cliffs. One "passage" goes North, one West, two
#     South, three East, and one (narrower, with two swellings, each
#     with a dot inside) goes SouthEast. The passages going North and
#     East are more or less aligned with the roads between the SW,
#     W, and S rosettes, that start just outside the text ring.
#     However the match is not perfect, as if the text ring marked an
#     ellipsis or a change of scale.
#     
#     Inside the scalloped area there is an elliptical "flower bed"
#     surrounded by a band of scales. At the four cardinal points, the
#     scales pile up into four fountains, whose jets point at nothing in
#     particular. The flower bed is filled with 24 tiny flowers or
#     stars. In the center there is a flower-like object with 6 round
#     "petals" and a doubly-traced outline.
#     
#     There are several labels (unit "B1") on or near this rosette.
#     One label in the scalloped-outline area, at 07:30, seems
#     associated with the area itself, or the flower bed inside it.
#     Another 9 labels seem associated with the 8 "passages" leaving the
#     scalloped area, and perhaps with the fountains at the corners of
#     the flower bed. Two more labels lie on the "sea", between the
#     text ring and the scalloped area, at 08:00 and 11:00. Four more
#     labels, reading radially outwards, lie just outside the text
#     ring, between 04:30 and 06:00; they may be associated with the
#     passages going Southeast (although they are not aligned with
#     them).
#     
#     Outside the text ring, Northwest from the rosette, there is a
#     roundish textured area surrounded by several wavy lines,
#     resembling a small "island" with steep coastline. A broad,
#     slighlty divergent band with wavy outlines, resembling a
#     torrential stream of water, goes from the island to the edge of
#     plateau (passing under the text ring). Two curves lines of text
#     are written along the stream's axis, and a third is written
#     along its Southern edge. On the Northeast side of the island
#     there is a tuff of curved hairs, so that the island looks like
#     an onion with its roots.
#     
#     On the opposite side of the rosette (07:30), also outside the
#     text ring there is a small circle (with double outline decorated
#     with 8 sets of three cross-hatches). The circle is surrounded by
#     a short ring of text (half clockwise and half counterclockwise).
#     Inside the circle there are three dots connected into an "L"
#     with equal arms. Two labels, reading radially towards the the
#     rosette, lie on each side of the small circle. A "dock"
#     resembling a double-traced squarish "U" extends out of the SW
#     rosette towards the small circle.
#     
#     Connecting the SW and W rosettes there is a "road", looking like
#     a causeway bordered by artificial-looking walls. The road is
#     actually a diamond-shaped loop, with slightly concave sides. The
#     North and South corners of this diamond connect to the two
#     rosettes; the West and East corners of the diamont open into
#     small round courts. Around this diamond are some wavy lines that
#     suggest steep rocky cliffs. The four corners of the diamond are
#     labeled, and there are two more labels in the "sea" on both
#     sides (all in unit "B1" too).
#     
#     The SW and S rosettes are connected by a broad bowtie-shaped
#     "isthmus", apparently with steep rocky shores. A thick
#     "fortified wall", fringed with "M"-shaped merlets on both sides,
#     runs along the Southern "shore" of the isthmus. North of this
#     wall are two triangular "fields", taking up most of the
#     isthmus, covered by parallel lines and many vertical sticks or
#     poles. There is a label just north of the wall, and another
#     just off the Northern "shore".
#
#   The SE rosette (panel f86r5)
#   
#     This panel is not available, but on panel f86r3 one can see half of the connection
#     between rosette SE and rosette S.  This connection too is a bow-shaped isthmus.
#     The multiple wavy outlines suggest steep shores on both sides. There is a 
#     narrower bowtie-shaped "road" on the isthmus, next to the South shore cliff.
#     This road has no parapets or merlets, but its edges are scalloped. Between
#     the road and the North shore cliffs there is a band of scales, pointing seawards.
#     There are two labels (unit "B3") just off the shore, one on each side of the
#     isthmus.
#   
#   The N rosette (panel f86r4)
#   
#     This rosette is surrounded by ring of text (unit "V2"). The ring
#     is fairly round but the presumed guiding circles are not
#     visible.
#
#     Just inside this ring there is a band of scales, as in the NE
#     rosette. However there are no hairs or dots. Instead the scales
#     seem to pile up into 13 conical "fountains" (11 visible and 2
#     inferred), pointing inwards.
#     
#     The fountains seem to be blowing or spraying a "windmill" that
#     takes up most of the space inside the rosette. Each fountain
#     points into the notch between consecutive "blades" of the
#     windmill. In each sector, between consecutive fountains, there are
#     10 labels, aligned with the tips of the windmill blades, reading
#     radially inwards. (Two of the sectors are hidden by the
#     "waterfall", see below.)
#     
#     The central "windmill" resembles the central structure of the
#     diagram in <f68v1>. It consists of a fat star (or toothed disk)
#     divided into 13 "blades" or sectors shaped like narrow kites.
#     Each sector is split lengthwise into a solid dark-colored half
#     (the most clockwise one) and a "starry" half. The latter
#     contains many tiny stars against a colored background. The
#     approximate star counts, clockwise from North, are
#
#       sector 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13
#              -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
#       stars  11 10 10 10 09 10 11 10 11 10 11 10 10
#     
#     The actual counts may be one or two higher.  Thus there are
#     133 stars, perhaps a little more.  This is almost exactly twice
#     the total number of stars in the windmill of <f68v1> (66-67).
#     
#     A "flow" of some sort seems to be taking place between the
#     windmill's South edge and the central rosette. The flow has
#     triangular or conical shape, and is marked with stream lines and
#     many small circles suggesting droplets. It is not entirely clear
#     which way the flow is moving; but its South end has smaller
#     "droplets", and exits or enters a hole at the top of a conical
#     pile of scales, similar to the fountains inside the N rosette
#     but larger.
#
#     A narrow stick or tube, with a round swelling near its tip,
#     extends Southwards from the center of the windmill, for about
#     half its radius. (It is probably perpendicular to the windmill's
#     plane, but drawn as if looking from a North-South direction.)
#
#   The S rosette (panel f86r3)
#   
#     This rosette, like the others, is framed by a ring of text
#     (unit "C2") between two faint mechanically drawn circles. There is a wide
#     gap in the text between 06:00 and 06:45.
#     
#     The space inside the ring is largely occupied by 
#     a "windmill" object somewhat similar to the one inside 
#     the N rosette.  This windmill too has the outline of a fat 
#     star divided into 13 narrow kite-shaped sectors. However,
#     instead of being bisected into dark and light halves,
#     here the sectors alternate between dark solid color
#     and starry sky pattern.  The necessary exception
#     is the sector at 08:00, which is bisected by a 
#     wavy line that slaloms between two rows of dots;
#     the clockwise half is starry, the other is solid dark.
#     The star counts per sector, starting with this one, are
#
#       sector  01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13
#               -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
#       stars   12 -- 19 -- 25 -- 24 -- 26 -- 22 -- 24
#     
#     i.e. 152 stars.
#     
#     There is no tube at the center of the windmill, only a 
#     faint circular marking, possibly containing two Voynichese
#     letters.
#     
#     At the tip of almost every sector there is a small round bulb,
#     and attached to almost every bulb is a fan-like structure
#     of varying width. When present, the fan starts from a small
#     pointed spike at the at distal end of the bulb, and stops at the
#     surrounding text ring. For the broadest fans, the spike seems to
#     have opened to a crown of points. More precisely, starting from
#     the split sector at 08:00 we have
#     
#       sector            01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 ** 12 ** 13
#                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
#       bulb at tip        Y  Y  Y  Y  ?  ?  ?  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  ?  Y  Y 
#       spike(S)/rown(W)   S  S  S  S  ?  ?  ?  S  S  S  W  ?  ?  ?  W 
#       fan width(N,0..2)  2  ?  ?  N  N  N  N  0  N  0  1  2  2  2  2 
#       
#     The two "**" entries above refer to a pair of "extra" fans that 
#     start from narrow stalks growing from the notch between two star tips.
#     
#     Some of the bays between consecutive star tips contain labels
#     (unit "B2"), reading radially inward.
#     
#     Symmetrically to the N rosette, there is a big fan-shaped flow
#     between an aperture in the central rosette and the whole North
#     edge of the windmill. The flow is marked with stream lines
#     (diverging from the North vertex) and small chevrons pointing
#     South, towards the windmill. The flow seems to emanate from a
#     bottle-shaped nozzle on the wall of the central rosette.
#     
#   The W rosette (on the fold between panels f85v1 and f85v2)
#   
#     This rosette is similar to the North and South ones, in that it
#     has a ring of text (unit "N1") surrounding a "windmill", which
#     is sprayed by a "flow" emanating from the central rosette.
#     However the fold and the poor copy quality prevent us from
#     checking many of the details that are visible in the other two.
#
#     The text ring is interrupted at 09:45 by a decorated rectangle
#     (a laterally compressed version of the "notched square" marker).
#     
#     The West windmill is smaller than its North and South
#     companions. It is divided into 18 kite-shaped sectors,
#     alternating beyween solid medium-light color and starry sky
#     pattern. Clockwise from 09:00, the star counts are
#     
#       sector   01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
#                -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
#       stars    ?? -- >6 -- 07 -- 05 -- ?? -- 10 -- 09 -- 09 -- 10 --
#       
#     So there are more than 56, probably around 80 stars on this windmill.
#
#     About two dozen thin beams or "stalks" emanate from the windmill
#     (both from the tips of the sectors and from the throughs between
#     sectors). the stalks end in round bulbs. These in turn are
#     connected to a scalloped circle that resembles a ring of round
#     arches.
#     
#     The "flow" is somewhat smaller than the North and South ones,
#     and consists of several tinsel-like strands with the barbs 
#     pointing towards the windmill; it is similar to the South flow,
#     but the barbs are pointing in the opposite sense.  The 
#     strands converge on (or diverge from a point on the wall
#     of the center rosette---which is unfortunately obscured by the fold.
#     
#     Between the text ring and the arches there are 8 labels (one of them,
#     obscured by the fold), reading radially inwards (unit "M1").
#     
#   The central rosette (on the fold between panels f86r3 and f86r4).
#   
#     The usual text ring (unit "N2") is surrounded in this case by a
#     complex band, entirely covered with outward-pointing scales and
#     other structures. Exposed scales are seen to have a dark spot
#     near the middle. The band of scales is edged on the outside with
#     many triangular "teeth" (spines, flames, grass blades) and then
#     by a ring of tiny dots. The inner edge of the band has a row of
#     fan-shaped elements (resembling gingko leaves),also pointing
#     outwards. From among the scales thre arises at regular inervals
#     a group of five or six tubes (a wide one at the center, with
#     smaller and shorter tubes surrounding it). All tubes have 
#     an open, clean-cut end.
#     
#     Inside the text ring there are two additional concentric bands
#     of outward-pointing scales.   The outermost of these two bands 
#     is fringed by hairs, also pointing outwards. 
#     
#     In the annular space between the text ring and the the second
#     band of scales there are 19 labels, reading radially inwards ---
#     all between 17:30 and 02:30.
#     
#     Around the North half of that annular space there is also a thin
#     semicircular line that is interrupted several times by
#     triple-scalloped indentations.
#     
#     The inner band of scales is a bit flattened, like a disk seen in
#     perspective. Inside the band there are half a dozen "mushrooms"
#     in a circle. Each mushroom consists of a "stalk" and a "head",
#     topped by a "roof". The stalk is a chubby cylinder with its
#     bottom half encased in a short "sock" that flares out near the
#     ground, then narrows again. The "head" is spherical and
#     featureless. The "roof" is shaped like an upside-down trumpet,
#     with thick lip, and ends with a sharp point at the top.
#     
#     Further inside the mushroom ring there is a ring of unidentified
#     shapes (perhaps resembling human silhouettes), and a dotted area
#     which may represent plants.
#
#     Between the mushrooms there are a few words of text (also in 
#     unit "M2").
#   
# Comments:
#
#   LOW-LEVEL INTERPRETATION
#
#   I.e. what objects was the artist trying to draw? 
#
#   The hatched areas outside the rosettes could be sea waves, rocky terrain,
#   flesh, clouds, cave walls, and many other things.  However the details
#   of the NE to N road sugegst they are cliffs rising from the sea.
# 
#   The object inside NE rosette could be a cutaway view of a hollow
#   shell, with a layer of "scales" on the outside, and
#   inward-pointing flames or spines on the inside. The label seems to
#   be applied the shell itself.
#
#   The opening could also be a mouth with teeth; but the shape,
#   curvature, and slant or the "teeth" are not correct. It could also
#   be eye with eyelashes; but the same objection applies, and there
#   is no hint of iris and pupil.
#
#   The tower-like structure on the N to NE road could be a fountain.
#   There are faint markings South of it that could be a puddle of water,
#   or a standing person (with one arm on the "fountain"), or...
#
#   The two roads connecting the N rosette to the plaza West of it
#   could be either bridges or, two lanes separated by a flower bed.
#
#   The knobs at the corners of the SW-W road could be towers seen
#   from dead above (the apparent perspective for this part of the
#   drawing), dropping straight down to the sea level. But they could
#   also be landing pads at sea level...
#
#   The grooved areas North of the wall on the SW-S isthmus could 
#   represent plowed and planted fields, or vineyards.
#
#   HIGH-LEVEL INTERPRETATION
#
#   I.e. what is the purpose of this picture?
#
#   The sun in the NE corner suggests a cosmological interpretation.
#   On the other hand, the tubes suggest anatomy, or (less likely)
#   plumbing, while the roads and tower suggest a map.
#
#   The whole diagram may be a graphic equivalent of the description
#   of the cosmos given in 1 Enoch and other ancient texts, where
#   natural phenomena like planetary motions, rivers, winds, rains,
#   springs, etc. are said to be produced in some "cosmic factory".
#
#   Alternatively, it could be a "biological factory" explanation of
#   human physiology.
#
#   Perhaps this diagram is an attempt to draw the mysterious device
#   described in the Cabal, or the apocalyptic vision of Ezra, or 
#   Heron's hydraulic gadgets, or...
#
#   Just to cover all the bases: it could be a report from a time
#   traveler or UFO abductee: the NW rosette is a fusion reactor, the
#   pipes leaving it carry steam for heating, the N/S/W/E rosettes are
#   steam turbines, the bulb-headed towers in the center are
#   rockets... 8-)
#
#   Another possibility is that it is a "fantasy island", like many
#   kids like do draw (and grown-ups too---consider Tolkien's maps of
#   Middle Earth)

# Identification:
#
#   Title: "T-O Map and 
#   Page: f86v3 = NL (Rene) = p176 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f86
#   Panels: f86v3
#   Bifolio: bN1 = f85+f86
#   Quire: N (Rene) = XIV (Beinecke)
#
#   Newbold plate VII, calls it f86v
#   SciAm
#   Brumbaugh p54, calls it f85r
#   Same as or includes page 174?
#
#   This is the back side of the bottom center panel of a 12-panel fold-out.
#   The bottom side of the panel is a folio edge.
#   The top side of the panel is the horizontal crease.
#   The left side of the panel is a vertical ridge crease.
#   The right side of the panel is the binding gutter.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: B (Currier)
#   Hand: 3 (Currier)
#   Subsets: C (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: cosmological
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   Gathering mark 14.
#
#   Text and drawing take up most of the page, right up to the 
#   edges, except for some white space left in the middle.
#
#   Four tapering, densely decorated "biological" structures
#   grow from the four corners of the page towards the center.
#
#   Between these structures there are four paragraphs of normal-looking text.
#   right next to the respective edge, to be read clockwise.
#   In the rectangular area bounded by them, there are two more
#   paragraphs, interrupted by part of the Northwest structure.
#
#   At the very center of the page, below the two extra paragraphs, there is
#   a mechanically drawn "T-O map"---a circle cut into three sectors
#   by a diameter (from 09:30 to 03:30) and a perpendicular radius (at 00:30).
#
#   At the left of the T-O map, and partly over it, there is a faint
#   irregular (pencil?) scribble, mostly illegible, resembling a young
#   child's scrawl. With some imagination, the first row can be read as
#   two EVA <l> (larger than normal), a latin "n" with acute accent, and
#   a latin "F"; below them is an EVA <s>, with very dark <c> and
#   lighter plume. But none of these readings can be considered
#   significant.
#
#   In the structure descriptions that follow, "up" means towards
#   the center of the page, "down" means towards its corner, 
#   "left" is clockwise and "right" is counter-clockwise.
#
#   The Northeast structure looks like a chalyx with thick stem, covered
#   with rounded, upward-pointing scales (or close-packed leaves). From
#   its hollow there comes forth a converging bundle of lines, like a
#   strong water jet (or a bundle of stalks). Halfway though the "jet"
#   but in front of it there is a bird with outspread wings. The "jet"
#   ends bruptly after a short distance, to be replaced by a dotted band
#   (dust? droplets? seeds?).
#
#   The Southeast structure has the shape of a light bulb, with the
#   narrow end pointing up . The base (wider end) is wrapped in a
#   leaf-like chalyx. The bulb is decorated with several bands of knobs,
#   hatchings, and upwards-growing scales. The narrow end (nearest to
#   the center of the page) ends in a hole with dotted lip. Coming out
#   from the hole we see the head of another bird, with its ouspread
#   wings partly visible, and three curved "stalks" carrying three
#   corncob-like objects.
#
#   The Southwest structure has a base that looks like a flattened
#   flower, whose petals are made of thick riveted metal plate. On top
#   of that "flower" there are three similar "stages", each smaller than
#   the previous one. Each "stage" looks like a ribbed stalk, short and
#   broad, ending with a multilobed sleeve which holds a heap of round
#   objects with dots at their centers. From the third stage there grows
#   a short "jet" (or a fourth ribbed stalk) that opens out into a 
#   funnel or corolla with serrated borders.  The right half of this 
#   funnel is dotted.
#
#   The Northwest structure looks like a wide and short cylindrical base
#   with a band of scales or flaps around its top part, pointing down.
#   On top of this base is a short conical dome covered with scales or
#   leaves. Each scale has a dot. From the very tip of the dome there
#   sprouts a divergent bundle of lines that ends with a cloud of dots,
#   like a water jet.
#
#   Behind the Northwest structure there is a human figure with light
#   long hair, probably a woman. Only her head and hand are visible,
#   just to the right of the "water jet".
#
#   Behind the Southwest structure there is another human figure with
#   short dark hair, probably a man. Only his right arm, part of his
#   breast, and half of his face are visible, on the left side of the
#   structure.
#
#   The man's right hand seems to be holding a short tube, pointed
#   towards the woman. Issuing from it is a short jet of dots that ends
#   abruptly after a couple of feet. (The man may also be throwing
#   things at the woman, and the "tube" could then be the motion traces.)
#   The woman seems to be waving at the man.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: ???
#   Page: f89r2 = OF (Rene) = p182 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f89
#   Panels: f89r2, f89r3
#   Bifolio: bO2 = f88+f89
#   Quire: O (Rene) = XV (Beinecke)
#
#   This page comprises the two outermost recto panels (f89r2 and
#   f89r3) of a six-panel fold-out. Panel f89r3 is half-width. The
#   paragraph lines span both panels, across the fold.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: A (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: P (Rene), pha (Stolfi)
#   Subject: pharmaceutical
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   This page contains 4 rows of plants (roughly next to the top edge,
#   1/3 down, 2/3 down, and next to the bottom edge).
#
#   The plant rows contain 4, 2, 6, and 4 plants, respectively. Plant
#   [1,4] has a long tapering root that runs down the right margin and
#   ends near the bottom right corner (which is torn off). Crammed
#   into the left margin, next to each row of plants, is a
#   "container"---an object resembling a decorated jar with pedestal.
#
#   Each container and each plant (except plant [3,6]) has a "label"
#   written next to it (units "L1","L2", "L3", and "L4"). From the
#   position of the labels it seems pretty clear which label goes with
#   which figure.
#
#   The plant rows are separated by three paragraphs with 2.8, 3.6,
#   and 6.0 lines (units "P1", "P2", and "P3").  The first three lines
#   of aragraph 3 are indented as if to leave space for a capital letter,
#   but that space is occupied by the root of plant [3,1]
#
#   There is a faint vertical crease in the vellum, about 1cm to the
#   right of the fold that separates panels f89r2 and f89r3, and
#   extending across the whole height of the page. The third paragraph
#   (but not the other two) is crease, but runs over the fold as if it
#   was not there. The crease and the fold are more conspicuous on the
#   verso side (page f89v2).
#
#   In the second line of paragraph 2 there seems to be a slit-like
#   defect in the vellum, flanked by two alternating rows of dots.
#   This defect is visible on the verso side too.

#
#       [4,3] [To be written]
#
#       [4,4] [To be written]
#   
# Comments:
#
#   [long root and leaves of [1,4] may match solatrium's; check!]
#
#   The vellum defect on paragraph 2 sems to be a slit in the vellum
#   that was at one time closed by sewing. If this interpretation is
#   correct, then the thread is gone, and the alternating dots are 
#   the stitch holes.

# Identification:
#
#   Title: ???
#   Page: f89v2 = OG (Rene) = p183 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f89
#   Panels: f89v3, f89v2
#   Bifolio: bO2 = f88+f89
#   Quire: O (Rene) = XV (Beinecke)
#
#   This page comprises the two outermost verso panels (f89v3 and
#   f89v2) of a six-panel fold-out. Panel f89v3 has half-width. The
#   paragraph lines span both panels, across the fold.
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: A (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: P (Rene), pha (Stolfi)
#   Subject: pharmaceutical
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   This page contains 3 rows of plants (next to the top edge,
#   across the middle, and next to the bottom edge), separated by
#   two blocks of text.
#
#   The plant rows contain 5, 3, and 4 plants, respectively. Crammed
#   into the left margin, next to each row of plants, is a
#   "container"---an object resembling a decorated jar with pedestal.
#   Each container and each plant has a "label" written next to it
#   (units "L1","L2", and "L3"). From the position of the labels it seems
#   pretty clear which label goes with which figure.
#
#   The first block of text (unit "P1") consists of a single paragraph
#   with 3.6 lines. The second block (unit "P2") contains two
#   paragraphs, both with 3.8 lines.
#
#   There is a vertical crease in the vellum, about 1cm to the left of
#   the fold that separates panels f89v3 and f89v2. The crease extends
#   from the second line of the top paragraph down to the bottom edge
#   of the page. Eacept for the first line of the first paragraph, the
#   text carefully avoids that (clean and undamaged) crease, but runs
#   over the (dirty and worn-out) fold as if it was not there.
#   The crease has a similar effect on the recto side (page f89r2).
#
#   Near plant [2,3] there seems to be a slit-like defect in the
#   vellum, flanked by two alternating rows of dots. This defect is
#   visible on the verso side too.

# Comments:
#
#   [some drawings repeated in herbal]
#
#   [label "odor" from f101v2 mentioned here.]
#
#   From the layout of the text relative to the crease and fold, it
#   looks as if the crease was a defect of the vellum, already present
#   when the page was written; but the fold was neither present nor
#   explicitly planned for.

#
#   Root: a very broad tuber, like a fat pancake with a mostly light
#     upper surface and dark edge.  The "pancake" is slightly bent with
#     left and right edges higher than the middle. A ring of 15 "fat
#     mousetail" roots --- dark, short and S-shaped --- sprout from the
#     edge; they seem to support the "pancake" like the legs of a
#     table. The three ones in front are much thicker than the 12 in the
#     back.  (Note that if the thick roots were split in two, there will
#     be 18 roots, close to the 19 of f39r.)
#   Stem: many short straight stems sprout separately from the top surface
#     of the "pancake". Each stem ends with a leaf and flower; the
#     longer ones have additional leaves attached to them.
#   Branches: occasional short branches, each having a 
#     single leaf and flower at the tip.
#   Leaves: two spindle-shaped leaves fused at the base, forming a 
#     "V" with fat arms and pointed tips.  No leaf stalks.
#   Flowers: one per branch.
#     Stalk: longish.  Chalyx: spindle-shaped, with smooth rim.  Petals
#     and core: none.
#
#   An almost identical copy of this drawing appears on f39r. This one
#   is drawn with less skill and/or care. The root shape is more
#   irregular, its top surface is medium dark, and the flowers have only
#   a flat circle in place of the corolla and core.
#   Also the flowers sprout from the tip of each stem or branch.

#   Roots:  dark with many spindle-like tubers, resembling yam or manioc.
#   Stem: single, upright with round swelling just above ground.
#   Leaves: stellated, with 10-13 fingers, distal ones somewhat longer.
#   Petiol: attached to leaf palm between two shortest fingers.
#   Leaf arrangement: basically paired.
#   Flowers: one big flower or inflorescence at the top, shaped like an
#     oversize cashew nut. The narrower end is lighter and attached to
#     the plant, and covered by tight bracts resembling those of an
#     eggplant.  The wider end is crowned by a light patch surrounded by
#     short, narrow, curved petals, and filled with concentric dotted
#     circles---possibly a cluster of small mature flowers.

#   An enlargement of this page is reproduced in O'Neill's paper,

#
#   This page spans two normal-size panels (f101v2 and f101v1) in a
#   four-panel fold-out folio. They were originally entered as two
#   separate pages (f101v2 and f101v1). However the text and plants

#
# Description:
#
#   The top 2/3 of the page contain three rows of plants, with 9, 9,
#   and 10 plants, respectively. The fold between the two panels falls
#   to the right of plants [1.4] and [2.4], and cuts through plant
#   [1.5].
#   
#   In rows 1 and 2, each plant has a one-word label (units "R1" and
#   "R2"), at its right or above, except perhaps for plant [1,7]. The
#   plants in row 3 are unlabeled.
#     
#   There are also three containers crammed into the left margin of
#   the page (panel v2 only), next to each row of plants. No labels
#   are visible on them (but the image is too dark to tell for sure).
#   All three containers have a simple cylindrical shape. They are
#   dark painted, undecorated except for a few narrow rings, light
#   colored, some of them with dots. The relative ring positions, from
#   the bottom, are: 0.0, 0.7, 1.0 (top container); 0.0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0
#   (middle), and 0.0, 0.8, 1.0 (bottom).
# 
#   Below the plants are three paragraphs, with 2.7, 2.8, and 3.0 lines
#   (unit "P"). The first two lines of the paragraph 1 are interrupted
#   by the roots of plants [3,8] and [3,9].
#
#   Below the last paragraph there is a centered partial line or "title"
#   (unit "T").  It may be simply the last line of paragraph 3.
#
#   Plant descriptions:
#
#     ROW 1:
#     
#       1 headroot, bugroot, bird or crab?root [John Grove]
#  
#       [1,1] Root: two thick horizontal roots; the left one seems truncated,
#         the right one makes an S-curve, and tapers down to a blunt point.
#         Stem: vertical and unbranched. Leaves: rounded, with five
#         big dents and many smaller ones (like a coarse circular saw blade);
#         with long stalks, paired except for a lone leaf at top. (May be flowers?). 
#  
#       [1,2] Root: fat knobby carrot. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves:
#         trowel-shaped, drooping, no stalks, toothed edges.  Flower:
#         one, large, horizontal; the image is too dark to see any detail.
#  
#       [1,3] Root: rather peculiar---the base of the stem bifurcates 
#         like an inverted "U", and each arm ends with a "fat carrot",
#         barely wider than it. The arms of the "U" are thicker than the
#         stem and almost as thick as the "carrots"). Stem: vertical,
#         with two paired horizontal branches. Leaves: quite strange, look like
#         ice-cream cones with thick walls, inserted upside-down on the
#         leaf stalks.
#  
#       [1,4] Root: begins like a small carrot but immediately splits 
#         into three tapering and diverging rootlets. Stem: vertical,
#         with two paired horizontal branches. Leaves: on medium-length
#         stalks, paired (except for lone leaf at top), triangular, with
#         two round lobes and two "horns" on the long sides, near the
#         base. (Each leaf resembles a toy "space shuttle" with two
#         pairs of wings).
#  
#       [1,5] This plant is barely visible in the source image, but part
#         of it can be seen in the reproduction of page f101v2. Root:
#         dense round mass, perhaps a spiny tuber. Stem: unbranched,
#         vertical. Leaves: two, oblong, paired, at end of stem.
#         
#       [1,6] Root: "fat crossed legs". Stem: vertical, unbranched.
#         Leaves: paired, triangular, with somewhat drooping stalks.
#         
#       [1,7] Root: "lock of hair".  Stem: vertical, unbranched.
#         Leaves: paired, broad, lance-shaped, with slightly dented edges,
#         pointing fully down.
#         
#       [1,8] Root: two horizontal, diverging,tapering branches. Stem:
#         vertical, unbranched, slightly curved.  Leaves: maize-like,
#         without stems, curved down.  The leaves are partly obscured
#         by bleedtrough from the leaves of f101r1[1,2]
#         
#       [1,9] Root: four horizontal branches, two on either side;
#         the bottom ones are shorter and curved inwards, like 
#         crab's claws. Stem: vertical, unbranched.  Leaves:
#         oval, ending with a point, with short stems; paired and
#         perpendicular to the stem, except for a single leaf at the
#         top.
#
#     ROW 2:
#       
#       [2,1] Looks like a single leaf, without root or stem.
#         The leaf is round, dark, with scalloped edges. In the center
#         of the top side there is a light "C", with the opening pointing SE;
#         the stalk is apparently attached to the underside, roughly at
#         the center of the "C".
#        
#       [2,2] Root: with two horizontal branches, dark and thickened,
#         with downturned tips and many down-pointing hairs (like a thick
#         moustache that needs to be trimmed.)  Stem: straight, pointing NE,
#         with two paired branches that start horiontal but curve up
#         (the whole resembles a three-armed candelabrum). Leaves:
#         three flyswatter-like leaves (or dense leaf clusters) with 
#         toothed distal edge.
#        
#       [2,3] Root: a tilde-shaped main root, almost horizontal,
#         pointing W, with 7 short, tapering, curved rootlets (like bird's claws).
#         Stem: vertical, unbranched.  Leaves: a big round leaf, with toothed edge,
#         and a wide slice missing at the bottom part (where the stem is
#         connected to the leaf center). Alternatively it could be
#         a fan-like cluster of tightly packed, long and narrow leaves.
# 
#        
#       [2,4] Root: it has two horizontal branches, smooth, tapered
#         and slightly curved, each having a roundish "hump" where it
#         gets near the stem. It also has a "fat mousetail" stretching
#         down from the base of the stem and gradually curving towards
#         West. Stem: vertical, somewhat curved, unbranched. Leaves (or
#         flowers): light-colored, two paired, three alternate, a single
#         one at the end of the stem; all with long slightly crooked
#         stalks. Each leaf is a star with 8 to 10 sharp triangular
#         rays, with a dot at the center.
#  
#       [2,5] Root: two short worm-like branches, bent horizontally to the left.
#         Stem: practically none. Leaves: Large, round, with round-toothed
#         edges, coneccted directly to the root by thin mostly upright 
#         stalks.  The leaves were painted in alternating lightand dark tones.
#         (The "leaves" could also be leaf clusters, and the "stalks" could be
#         branches.) 
#         
#       [2,6] Root: a small knobby carrot, dark, pointing to the right.
#         Stem: several twisted branches rising from the root. Leaves:
#         round, with large round teeth, with stems resembling the branches.
#         
#       [2,7] Root: very small, basically six short strokes pointing 
#         to the sides and down.  Stem: practically null.  Leaves:
#         two, paddle-shaped, paired.
#         
#       [2,8] Root: long and thin, unbranched, worm-like, growing
#         almost horizontally to the left, ending with a single whisker.
#         Stem: short and upright. Leaves: only one, growing up from
#         the top of the stem; broad, eye-shaped, with many peg-like
#         teeth.  
#         
#       [2,9] Root: a short knobby carrot, growing horizontally
#         to the left.  Stem: none. Leaves: broad, lance-shaped,
#         undulating, with a medium-length stalk, attached directly to the root.
#       
#     ROW 3:
#       
#       [3,1] Root: a small bulbous tuber, bent W (like a small 
#         eggplant), ending with a short rootlet. Stem: vertical,
#         unbranched.  Leaves: eigth paired, one at the top; feather-like
#         with many sharp leaflets, resembling the branches of a pine
#         tree. (The image is too dark to tell for sure).
#           
#       [3,2] Root: a dense brush of short S-shaped rootlets, with a 
#         single long mousetail stretching out in the SW direction. Stem: verrtical,
#         unbranched, slightly curved NW at the top. Leaves: triangular, 
#         with slightly serrated edges, narrow but stiff, horizontal, paired,
#         with medium-short stalks.  Flower(?): a large one at the top of the
#         stem, resembling a sunflower, apparently without petals. (That part
#         of the image is obscured by a blot or bleedthrough.)
#        
#       [3,3] Root: four straight spines, narrow and sharp, pointing 
#         SW.  Stem: vertical, short, unbranched. Leaves: a single
#         broad fan-shaped cluster, resembling the tail of a turkey.
#         Each leaf is long with a rounded tip, slightly curved
#         upwards.  Flowers(?): two, with long stalks branching out 
#         diagonally from mid-stem and extending above the leaf cluster.
#         The chalyx(?) looks like a flat round saucer; the 
#         corolla is cylindrical, with scalloped upper edge. 
#         (Details are hard to see in the image.)
#        
#       [3,4] Root: shaped like a fat comma, with a human face
#         on the round part, and a couple of whiskers extending
#         Westward from the tip. Stem: straight, with two
#         nearly horizontal short branches, paired.  Leaves:
#         seven, irregularly placed, with medium-short stalks.
#         Each leaf is wider than its length, with 4-5 rounded 
#         lobes on the distal edge (vaguely like the outline of 
#         a Chinese pot-sticker). 
# 
#       [3,5] (This plant is largely obscured by the fold between
#         panels v2 and v1.)  Root: only one tip is visible, West of the 
#         fold---mostly horizontal, curved up, cylindrical, ending abruptly
#         with a hooked rootlet. Stem: apparently short and vertical. Leaves:
#         a single fan-like cluster, about 60 degrees wide, of long narrow 
#         leaves, resembling palm leaflets.
#  
#       [3,6] Root: small nondescript tuber with many hairs. Stem:
#         vertical, unbranched.  Leaves: broad, lance-shaped (almost round),
#         with a short "beak". 
#       
#       [3,7] Root: small carrot-like main root ending with three short rootlets.
#         Stem: two branches (or leaf stalks) rising from the root, one vertical, one oblique.
#         Leaves: two, each with 5 lance-shaped fingers, narrow and long,
#         fanning out from the end of the stalk, with a spread of about 60 degrees.
#         
#       [3,8] Root: twisted humpy tuber, mostly horizontal, with several
#         rootlets at the periphery. Stem: straight, unbranched. Leaves:
#         two paired, lance-shaped, with very short stalks, attached at
#         mid-stem. Flowers: a single spindle-shaped inflorescence, at the
#         tip of the stem.
#         
#       [3,9] Root: two round, light tubers, with a fringe of rootlets at the 
#         bottom. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves: almond-shaped, 
#         tapering to a point; paired, except for the only one at the top. 
#         
#       [3,10] Root: a round bulb with a long, narrow, tapering root growing
#         horizontally to the right. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves:
#         triangular "fans" or "spatulas" (somewhat gingko-like) broad and
#         short, paired, attached directly to the stem and coplanar with
#         it. Fruits: three dark berries with medium-length stalks and a
#         light-colored circle at the top. (The "fruits" could be
#         flowers.)
#
# Comments:
# 
#   As proof that panels f101v2 (this page) and f101v1
#   comprise a single logical page, note that v1 has no containers,
#   but otherwise has the same layout as v2: three rows of plants (the
#   first two labeled), and three paragraphs at the bottom. Moreover
#   the paragraphs in v2 have 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 lines, all aligned
#   with those of v1; and the last paragraph of v2 is followed by a
#   right-justfied title---which lines up neatly with the last line of
#   v1. [Stolfi]
#
#   The source of the reproduction in O'Neill's paper is acknowledged
#   as "Through the kindness of Mrs Voynich, the owner of the Ms, Dr.
#   Petersen of this institution, possesses a photostat copy of it".
#   [Gabriel 98/Mar/07]
#
#   The position of the containers suggests they were not
#   planned from the beginning, but added after the plant drawings
#   were complete. In fact this seems to be true of the whole pharma
#   section. [Stolfi]
#
#   "Fair copies" of some of these plant drawings are found elsewhere. [Stolfi]
#   
#   Some of the plants on row 2 could be algae. [Stolfi]
#
#   Plant [1,2] strongly resembles the "sunflower" on f93r. [Stolfi]
#
#   Plant [2,4] has roots with 'knots' as if it's a tree. The leaves
#   look like chestnut's. [Rene 98/Aug/16]
#
#   The leaves and overall shape of plant [3,1] resemble those of 
#   plant f100v[3,3]. [Stolfi]
#
#   The root and face on the root of plant [3,4] are standard medieval
#   symbolism. (Presumably it means that a "good" specimen is one
#   whose shape and spots resemble a human face, just as a "good"
#   mandrake root is one that resembles a human body.) [Stolfi 98/Aug/13]

#
#   Two blocks of text and three rows of plants: 
#
#      [1,1]..[1,7] top of page; leaves, "cube root"
#      [2,1]..[2,7] just below first row: more leaves.
#      [3,1]..[3,5] between the two text blocks: roots with leaves.
#
# Comments:
#
#    Plant 4 of the last row has "same" label as 
#    first plant on top row of f89v1.  The root is similar,
#    the leaves only vaguely so.

#
# Description:
#
#   This page is blank except for four lines of text at the top
#   (numbered "0" to "3") and some drawings at the top left corner. 
#   
#   The text is rougly justified against the left margin, and ragged
#   on the right. Line 0 is flush against the top edge of the vellum,
#   lines 1-3 lie about 1/2 inch below it, with normal interline
#   spacing. Except for two Voynichese words at the beginning of line
#   3, the text is written in a peculiar script ("Michitonese") that
#   seems to be intermediate between ordinary (Latin) alphabet and the
#   VMs script. The handwriting is irregular and not very readable.
#   The letters in line 0 is somewhat smaller but apparently in the
#   same handwriting as the rest.
#
#   The area next to the upper left corner is hevily stained and
#   wrinkled. There is a large hole in the vellum, 2-3mm wide, near
#   the upper left corner, about 2cm from the edges. Lines 1 and 2
#   of the text start right next to the hole.
#
#   In the dark region between the hole and the left edge, roughly
#   aligned with text line #2, there is the drawing of a four-legged
#   animal, resembling a dog with round ears, short hais, and a fat
#   but pointed tail. The animal is facing left, with the snout right 
#   against the vellum's edge.
#
#   Below the animal is a female nymph (with breasts), naked except for some
#   simple hat.  She is facing seems to be seated on a sloping surface,
#   right at the edge of the dark area, with arms stretched sideways
#   and down.
#
#   Above the anumal there is a drawing of an unidentified bulbous object.
#
#   There is a large question mark at the right margin, aligned with 
#   line 3 but well beyound its end.  It shows up in Newbold's reproduction.
#
#   In one reproduction of this page there is a very faint line of modern-style
#   digits below part of the first line. Each letter (but not the "+"
#   signs) has a single digit below it; except that one can see also
#   the numerals "10" and "13", each squeezed under a single letter.
#   (Part of the line is unreadable, so "11" and "12" could be there
#   too.) However these digits were probably scribbled on the copy,
#   since they do not show up in Newbold's reproduction.
#
# Comments:
#
#   THE SCRIPT
#
#   Jacques Guy [] mentions the Michitonese script resembles that of a
#   1460 German manuscript in Latin reproduced in [1, p.78]. In that
#   sample, there are letters that look like Voynich 8, but they stand
#   for "d" not "s". Final "s" is written like the modern "es-zet".
#
#   Jacques [29 Mar 1996] also suggest that "ct" coudl be a "t" as
#   found in Benaventan and Visigothic manuscripts, and "9" could
#   be "us".
#
#   Rene Zandbergen [27 Mar 1996] confirms similarity of Michitonese
#   with another German manuscript from 1440, in German [2]. In that
#   sample too `d' was written as `8', `so' was written "just like in
#   the VMS(?)", and `Venus' was written `Ven9'. He adds later [28 Oct
#   98] that the f116v text "looks more like a German hand than
#   anything else. Not Kircher's, not Marci's but earlier."
# 
#   Some of the "Michitonese" letters seem purposefully distorted to
#   resemble Voynichese letters.
#
#   Denis Mardle [19 Apr 97] notes that the Michitonese writing is
#   "not unlike" the small extraneous writing on f17r.
#
#   Stolfi [01 Nov 98] notes that the Michitonese script resembles
#   that of the "month names" in the center of the "zodiac" diagrams.
#   For example, the last character of line 1 is similar to the first
#   character of the Pisces label (f70v2). If the two sets are indeed
#   by the same hand, then the month names give valuable clues on the
#   Michitonese alphabet.
#
#   THE TEXT
#
#   Before seeing what the text actually looks like, Stolfi [5 Feb
#   1998] conjectured that the text could be an anagram, given that it
#   resembles a "Scrabble end-game". Unfortunately anagrams of that
#   size are practically unsolvable without a clue.
#
#   Common opinion is that the f116v text is scribblings by a would-be
#   decipherer. However this theory does not seem compatible with the
#   "ordinary" appearance of the text, and does not explain the
#   normal-looking Voynichese words ("oror sheey" in EVA) inserted in
#   the text.
#
#   Rene [5 Feb 1998] conjectures that the "would-be decipherer" is
#   the same person who wrote the character tables on f1r. Rene also
#   remarks that one can exclude Dee, Kelley, Askham, Ricci, and
#   Bacon, since the third line is very likely German.
#
#   Andras Kornai [25 Nov 1998] says that says that "-d" is the 2nd
#   person posessive ending in Hungarian, but the text does not seem
#   to be Hungarian.
#
#   Newbold [1921] reads the first line, rather arbitrarily, as "michiton
#   oladabas multos te tccr cerc portas" (and ignores the other three).
#   After many arbitrary manipulations he gets a "cipher key" out of it.
#
#   Brumbaugh reads the text as "(...)con olada ba", interprets
#   "con...ba" as an anagram of "bacon", and turns "olada" into
#   'rodgd' by adding 3 to each letter. Brumbaugh then says "rodgd"
#   means "roger"; but he concludes that this evidence was planted by
#   Dee/Kelly. (Reported by Rene [2 Feb 1998].)
#
#   Jim Reeds [15 Apr 94] quotes Erwin Panofsky [4] who reads the
#   second line as "so nim geismi[l]ch o", meaning, "... take goats
#   milk, or..."
#
#   Jacques Guy [] remarks that the the word that Newbold and others
#   read "valst" or "valsch" is actually "valde" ("strongly, very") in
#   the 1460 german manuscript [1, p.78].
#
#   Rene, tongue in cheek [15 Apr 1998], notes that the mapping
#   {ol->d, m->p, ch->e, d->b, b->n} turns "michiton oladabas" into
#   "pieiton d abanas", i.e. "Pietro d'Abano" modulo transcriber
#   errors.
#
#   Rene [07 Feb 96], looking at D'Imperio's photocopy, thinks that
#   there might be at least one (unreadable) letter before "michiton".
#
#   Rene [13 Mar 1996] noted that the text begins with "mich" and ends
#   with "nich", suggesting it was written by "MICHael voyNICH".
#
#   Rene [5 Feb 1998] notes that some Voynichese words are similar to 
#   "oladabas", e.g. the label on the NE corner of f67v2 ("otararain").
#   Dennis [28 Oct 1998] suggests "otardar" from f67r1 (outer circle,
#   at 11:00).  
#
#   Rene [28 Oct 1998] also suggests f76v.P.19 ("orar.sheey") as a
#   possible source for line 3.  Stolfi observes that there is also
#   an "aror.sheey" on f104r.P.28.
#
#   Stolfi [] remarks that "Olazabal" or "Olazbal" is a common mame 
#   in Spanish-speaking areas, probably of Basque origin.
#
#   THE DRAWINGS
#
#   Rene [18 Sep 1997] thinks the animal looks like a horse. Stolfi []
#   thought it could be a dog.
#
#   Rene also observes [] that the nymph on f116v looks very much like the
#   "dead" nymph on page ???---which also has extraneous writing, possibly
#   by the same hand.

#
# "U" transcription by J.Stolfi from a scanned image.
# Only the first two words of line 3 look like Voynichese.
#
# Transcription uses the "best matches" from Rene's German alphabet (RGA),
# with the following additions/deviations:
#
#   8    similar to RGA "d" (mainline variant), but the upper loop is smaller
#          than the lower loop, and almost straight above it.
#       An "a" with a faint dot over it (probably noise).
#       A "c" with a vertical serif at the top end.
#   h    very much like RGA "h", but with open bottom
#       A straight, short, thick descending stroke with a
#          straight, long, thin "acute accent"; like
#          an EVA "r" but with straight plume
#   j    a partially obscured glyph; what can be seen looks
#          like a printed lowercase "j", lower on 
#          the baseline and slanting to the left.
#   L    Similar to RGA "l" but more angular---a thin and tall triangle,
#          closed at the bottom and not connected to the neighbors.
#   M    like a large Greek "epsilon" or a "3" on its side, with 
#          first stroke turned inwards, the last slightly outwards.
#   m    with inclined strokes, like "\/\/\".
#   n    with inclined strokes, like "\/\".
#       like an "o" with a circumflex *under* it; or an EVA "l"
#          with very short "legs".
#   )    like a small close parenthesis, extending slightly below
#          the baseline; very much like the variant RGA "o" 
#          (bottom line of Rene's scan)
#   p    has an exaggerated "barb" on the left side of the 
#          stem.
#   r    like a Greek lowercase "nu".
#       an "u" or "n" with a macron or overline (which may be noise).
#   X    Like RGA "x", but with the two strokes ligated on the right.
#   y    similar to RGA "y", but more like a Greek "eta".
#   +    like a math "+", raised so as to stand on the baseline.
#   ^    partially obscured; the bottom part has two "feet"
#            on the baseline, very close together.
#
# In the "digits" line, "a" trough "d" mean "10" through "13", 
# each numeral being squeezed into single letter slot.
